# UX design

- UX design - coined by Donald Norman :
     - based on solid understanding of users and their needs
     - based on observations and interviews
     - includes “all aspects of the user’s interaction
     - with the product: how it is
          - perceived
          - learned
          - and used.”
- For a website or application, that includes the :
     - visual design
     - the user interface
     - the quality and message of the content
     - and even the overall site performance
- The experience must be in line with
     - the organization’s brand and business goals
     - in order to be successful.
