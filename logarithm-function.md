* IMPORTANT :
    * logarithm is the **inverse** of an exponential function
    * b^x = y | log_{b}y = x
        * on cartesian plane : x|y => y|x
        * input x -> f(exp) -> output y -> f(log) -> output(x)
    * inverse : cancel each other / undo
    * a log can undo an exponential
    * base of lagarithm is the same as base of exponential
    * log can be transformed to exp
    * ***logx : tell you how big x is

- richter scale is logarithmic scale
- log_{2}16 : log base 2 of 16
- base 10 logarithms are really important
