# sine and cosine

- THIS IS FOUNDATIONAL - EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
- newton - just unit of force
- you see, sine and cosine are the tools in trigonometry
- to take an angled force like this and **break it up**(the angled vector)
- into the horizontal piece of the force and the vertical piece of the force
- i always want to be able to **split** those arrows up
- into how much do i have in the horizontal way
- and how much do i have in the vertical direction

- so if i want to split the five newton force into
- a horizontal piece and a vertical piece
- in need 2 different functions :
    - sine : how much of this force is in the vertical direction
    - and cosine : how much in horizontal direction

- trigonometric ratios
- sine function how much of the force go up compare with the force i have
- cosine function how much of the horizontal force compare with the total force
- ratio - relationship - compare
- REMEBER :
    * [X] SINE GOES WITH THE Y
    - [X] COSINE GOES WITH X
- \sin \theta = 0.8 means 0.8 of total force is in y-direction
- \cos \theta = 0.6 means 0.6 of total force is in x-direction

* [X] THINK THESE AS **CHOPPING FUNCTION**
    - 5.sin(\theta)=4 : chop the 5 down in y direction
