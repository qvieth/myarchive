# OS
end user vs package maintainer
- Processes read data from input streams and write data to output streams
- The reason cat adopted an interactive behavior has to do with streams
- Because you did not specify an __input filename__, cat read from the standard input stream __provided by the Linux kernel__ rather than a stream connected to a file
- An embedded system is anything designed to serve a specific purpose, such as a music player, video streamer, or thermostat
- Compare this to a desktop or server system that can handle many different kinds of tasks (but may not do one specific thing very well)
- You can think of embedded systems as almost the opposite of distributed computing
- rather than expanding the scale of the operating system, an embedded system usually (but not always) shrinks it, often into a small device
- Android is perhaps the most widespread embedded version of Linux in use today
