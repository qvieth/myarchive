# which of these is a classification problem ?
- Once you decide to __leverage__ *supervised machine learning* to __solve a new problem__
    - you need to identify whether your problem is better suited to
        - classification
        - or regression

- This exercise will help you develop your intuition for distinguishing between the two

- Provided below are 4 example applications of machine learning
- Which of them is a supervised classification problem?
    - [x] Using labeled financial data to predict whether the value of a stock will go up or go down next week
    - [ ] Using labeled housing price data to predict the price of a new house based on various features
    - [ ] Using unlabeled data to cluster the students of an online education company into different categories based on their learning styles
    - [ ] Using labeled financial data to predict what the value of a stock will be next week

- In this example, there are two __discrete__, __qualitative__ outcomes: the stock market going up, and the stock market going down
    - This can be represented using a __binary variable__, and is an application perfectly suited for classification
