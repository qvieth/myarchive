# Roadmap How to Learn Machine Learning in 6 Months

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOdlp1d0PNA
- just one thing to remember :
    - JUST BUILD SOMETHING WITH DATA AND EXPECT TO SUCK AT IT FOR A WHILE

- NEVER BELIEVE WHAT SCHOOLS TELL YOU, COLLEGE TEACHERS ARE USUALLY OUT OF THE LOOP OR DO NOT KNOW THE LATEST SOFTWARE OR METHODS!!
- READ: JOB LISTINGS ON EMPLOYMENT SITES, TO SEE REALITY!!!!

## learn the math (2-3 months)
1. linear algebra
2. calculus :
    - gradient descent
    - determining whether your classification modeling is good
3. statistics
4. probability

## learn programming language (1 month)
- python

## machine learning tutorials and test projects(1-2 months)
- book : data science from sratch - oreilly
- machine learning pipeline :
    - find data (Web scrape, APIs, CSVs)
    - **clean the data (remove NaNs and infinities, should that be a string? probably not, maybe i can categorize it...) : this is where you spend 90% of your time
        - you'll spend alot of time in these sections, that's normal
    - choose and tune your algorithm
    - visualize results

## short term passion projects (1++ month)
- project
- do interview question
