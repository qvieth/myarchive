## FLEETING NOTES

- understand architecture -> read API -> code
- code only when you already understand the concept
- programming : types are object, functions are morphisms | a -> b -> b | arrow : f = a -> b, id_b = b -> b | id_b after f
- If you are a programmer, learning a new language is just a matter of 3 hours
     - Step 1: learn what that language can do.
     - Step 2: explore the best way to write a program in that language.
     - Step 3: Figure out how to debug and deploy that program
     - Now, start writing your own program. Keep googling
- expression vs statement : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)
     - Expressions PRODUCE AT LEAST ONE VALUE
     - expressions \subset statements
     - statement - single statement - compound statement
     - Classes allow programmers to implement abstract data types

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Thinking_before_coding : important, many insights
     - When starting with a web project, many people focus on the technical side
          - Of course you must be familiar with the technique of your craft, but what really matters is what you want to accomplish
          - Yes, it seems obvious, but too many projects fail not from a lack of technical know-how, but from **lack of goals and vision**
          - **A project should never starts with the technical side**
