## PRINCIPLES

```
think programming as all around variable <= NO MORE, paradigm
variable is value, function, object...
goal of programming is to transform variable
```

## FLEETING NOTES

- Caleb Curry - computer science : 4 layer :

```
    | user         |

    | applications |

    | OS           |

    | hardware     |
```

- between each of these layers is interface(how each layer communicate to each other)

- cs50 2018 - html,css,js : it's a human problem, not a technical one(when talking about wheter to bundle css and html in 1 file)
- hook - hook into - hook into the process otherwise would not have events
- function : group instruction into one
- anonymous => statement vs expression => memory vs calculation => learn C to grasp these concepts
- [the term context in programming](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6145091/the-term-context-in-programming)
- don't worry about remembering these code
  - **all i need to know is that these kinds of things are available**
  - and you can always head to the documentation if you want to find them out
- why learn to code :
  - i searched : learn bootstrap without coding and fall into blondiebytes channel which is really good
  - yesterday i searched bootstrap tutorial which has tons of code and it was good too
  - => for starting, not really focus on understanding, just so you can have a sense, look for code video
  - => for really understanding, look only for concepts, don't focus into codes
- opinionated vs unopinionated framework
- [AbstractVsConcreteSoftware](https://wiki.c2.com/?AbstractVsConcreteSoftware)
  - application : concrete software
  - program : both abstract and concrete
- understand architecture -> read API -> code
- code only when you already understand the concept
- programming : types are object, functions are morphisms | a -> b -> b | arrow : f = a -> b, id_b = b -> b | id_b after f
- If you are a programmer, learning a new language is just a matter of 3 hours
  - Step 1: learn what that language can do.
  - Step 2: explore the best way to write a program in that language.
  - Step 3: Figure out how to debug and deploy that program
  - Now, start writing your own program. Keep googling
- expression vs statement : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)
  - Expressions PRODUCE AT LEAST ONE VALUE
  - expressions \subset statements
  - statement - single statement - compound statement
  - Classes allow programmers to implement abstract data types

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Thinking_before_coding : important, many insights
  - When starting with a web project, many people focus on the technical side
    - Of course you must be familiar with the technique of your craft, but what really matters is what you want to accomplish
    - Yes, it seems obvious, but too many projects fail not from a lack of technical know-how, but from **lack of goals and vision**
    - **A project should never starts with the technical side**
