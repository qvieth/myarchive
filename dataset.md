# dataset
- A dataset is a __collection of data__ that relate to __particular subject__
- example : numbers of fish, grades of students, video dataset, audio dataset
- In the case of __tabular data__, a __dataset__ corresponds to one or more __database tables__
- where : 
    - every __column__ of a table represents a __particular variable__
    - each __row__ corresponds to a given __record__ of the data set in question
- The __data set__ lists __values__ for each of the __variables__, such as height and weight of an object, for __each member__ of the __data set__
- __Each value__ is known as a __datum__
- __Data sets__ can also consist of a __collection__ of __documents__ or __files__

- In the __open data__ discipline, __data set__ is the __unit to measure the information__ released in a __public open data repository__
- The European Open Data portal aggregates more than half a million data sets
- In this field other definitions have been proposed, but currently there is not an official one
- Some other issues (real-time data sources, non-relational data sets, etc.) increases the difficulty to reach a consensus about it
