# probability crash course part 1 and 2
## part 1
- Today we’re going to begin our discussion of probability
- We’ll talk about how the addition (OR) rule
    - the multiplication (AND) rule
- and conditional probabilities help us figure out the likelihood of sequences of events happening 
    - from optimizing your chances of having a great night out with friends to seeing Cole Sprouse at IHop!

- statisticians talk about 2 types of probability :
    1. empirical
        - something we observe in actual data 
    2. theoretical

## part 2
- Today we're going to introduce bayesian statistics
    - and discuss how this new approach to statistics has revolutionized the field
    - from artificial intelligence and clinical trials to how your computer filters spam!
    - We'll also discuss the Law of Large Numbers and how we can use simulations to help us better understand the "rules" of our data
- even if we don't know the equations that define those rules 
- bayes'theorem :
    - `P(B|A)=P(A|B)P(B)/P(A)`
- conditional probability :
    - `P(B|A)=P(AandB)/P(A)`

- __bayesian statistic__ is all about __updating__ your beliefs based on __new(more) information__
- frequentist statistic
- law of large number
