# Mean, median and mode : measure of central tendency
- mean : average
- mean is good at measuring things that are relatively '__normally__' distributed
- normal : a __distribution__ of data that has roughly the same amount of data on either side of the middle, and has its most common values around the middle of the data
- a distribution show us how often each value occurs in our data set, which is know as frequency
- outliers : 
- median : the middle number if we lined up our data from smallest to largest
- average is distorted by outliers
- the word __mode__ comes from the latin word modus, which means '__manner, fashion, or style__' and give us the french expression means __fashionable, popular__ a la mode
- mode : the value that appears most in our dataset
- bimodal data is an example of 'multimodal data' which has many values that are __similarly common__
- usually multimodal data results from two or more underlying groups all being measured together
- the fact that the __median__ and the __mean__ are __the same__ tell us that the __distribution is symetric__ 
    - that there's equal amount of data on __either side of the median__, and equal amounts on __either side of the mean__
- statisticians say the normal distribution has zero skew, since the mean and median are the same
- when the median and mean are different, a distribution is skewed, which is a way of saying that there are some unusually extreme values on one side of our distribution
- either large or small in our dataset
- an important part of statistics is understanding __which question you are trying to answer__ and __whether or not the information you have is answering those question__
