- Main outtakes of this lesson
1. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of US. Europe has the European Central Bank
    - Most Central Banks have two jobs:
        - they regulate and oversee the nation's commercial banks by making sure that banks have enough money in reserve to avoid bank runs
        - they conduct monetary policy which is increasing or decreasing the money supply to speed up or slow down the overall economy
2. Interest rate - the price of borrowing money
    - When interest rates are low, borrowers will find it easier to pay back loans so they will borrow more and spend more
        - When interest rates are high, borrowers borrow less and spend less 
    - Expansionary monetary policy - when central bank wants to speed up the economy, it will increase the money supply, which will decrease interest rates and lead to more borrowing and spending
    - Contractionary monetary policy - when central bank wants to slow down the economy, they decrease the money supply. Less money available will increase interest rates and decrease borrowing and spending 
3. Liquid assets - an asset that can be converted into cash quickly and with minimal impact to the price received
4. Open market operations - this is when the federal reserve buys or sells short term government bonds
5. Quantitative easing (Q.E.) - when central banks buy longer term assets from banks
6. Monetary policy - changing money supply to speed up or slow down economy
