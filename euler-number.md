# 14 what is euler s number e

- e is as important as pi
- the number 'e' (euler's number)
- e just pops up when you study exponential growth
- just like pi falls out of the equation when we talk about circle
- lnx = log_{e}x

- learn compound interest
    - A = P ( 1 + \frac{r}{n} ) ^nt
        - r = annual interest rate
        - n = # compoundings / yr
    - interest compound annually
    - interest compound every 6 month -> more money
    - interest compound monthly -> even more money

- euler's number
- e = lim_{n->\inf}(1+1/n)^n = 2.71828... -> irrational number
    * this answer comes from calculus

- if you pick the special case of trying to compound annually
    - where i'm gonna give you i'm going to double your money in a year
    - then that's exactly what you would get
- if i take that same rule trying to double your money
    - but i chop it up into 2 times a year doing it every six month
    - i get closer to euler's number
- if I instead compounded monthly again
    - giving you an annual rate of a hundred percent trying to
    - double your money then i get a little bit more than
    - double one dollar that i started with
- as you increase compouding periods to infinity you reach a limit
- so Euler's number is that limit
