# 12 what are inverse functions? find the inverse of a function and graph
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVG6MBFkiOo
- additive inverse
- multiplication inverse

- f(x) = (x+4)/2
- g(x) = 2x-4
a) f(g(-3))=-3
b) g(f(-4)=-4 -> get back what you put in
```
-> f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) = x
```
- undo
- it turns out that this undoing of one another is gonna help us solve lot of equations down the way
- that we don't know how to solve now mostly in the beginning we'll be solving exponential equations
- because the exponential function has an inverse i'm going to talk about later it's called the logarithmkk
