- 'Curve fitting without domain knowledge' - best tagline ever for AI


- unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics : why math describe so many things so good
- in most of the fields that we work with, and i would say that, in almost any introductory course
- the basic fundamental theoretical ideas that they will introduce you will be the concept of a **linear model**
- Neural Network :
    - `y_{i+1} = h(W_i * y_i + b_i)`
    - it's just that equation
    - the challenge is we don't know what the W's and the b's are
    - and we don't know how many layers there should be
    - and we don't know how many neurons should be in each layer
    - and although the features can be arbitrary, picking the right ones do matter and picking the right categories do matter
    - so people talk about i do machine learning or i'm off working on
    - they're basically playing with all of these parameters to try and find the ones that will work best for their problem
    - and there's a lot of trial and error, and you'll hear about there's now systems that try and use machine learning to do that process **automatically**
    - you know, how do you make machines that learn how to do machine learning
    - the basic approach is a **trial and error** approach
    - i take a whole bunch of pictures of cats - that i know i have cats in them, and other things right?
    - and i randomly set all those weights and thresholds
    - and i put in the vector and i see what the system
    - i guess what i think the number of layers and neurons
    - and i run it through the system and i get an estimate or a calculation for what i think these final value should be and i compare it with the truth
    - ... BACK PROPAGATE and INFERENCE
    - until eventually we get a **set of weights** that we think does the problem well enough for our purpose
    * if you can understand this equation, you'll be way ahead of most people in machine learning
    - you know, there's lots of people who understand about all the software package and the packages and the data, all of them just doing that
    - and i'd say this is one of the most powerful ways to be ahead in your field, is to actually understand the mathematical principles
    - because then the software and what it's doing is much clearer
    - and these people who don't understand these mathematical principles, they're really guessing
    - they're like, oh, well, i do this and i throw this module in, they don't really know that all it's doing is making adjustments to these various equations
    - how many different layers there are and stuff like that
    - now why is this important? why does it matter? we have this system, it works, but you don't know why, why does it important to know why?
    - well, there's two reasons
        - if we want to be able to apply this incredible innovation to other domains, other than language or vision, or standard problems, i kind of need some theory to know - math to guide your reasoning
