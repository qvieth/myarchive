- function : only one output for each input
    * can't have one to many relationship
    * y^{2}=x is not a function (1input->2output)
- linear function
- quadratic function
- cubic function
- trig function
- and many more..
- we tell they're functions just by looking at their graphs
    - because they all pass the
    * **'VERTICAL LINE TEST'**

- function table :

| input | output |

| x     | y      |
|       |        |
