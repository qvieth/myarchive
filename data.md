-   https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-ask-good-Data-Science-questions
    -   My trick is to find out if they are actionable, meaning, if I can or cannot take action based on the answer. To find out if they are actionable I make one follow up question: "What can I do if the answer is x?" where x is a possible, yet random answer.
    -   Good questions are asked after you have done exploratory data analysis and basic visualizations.
    -   Better questions are asked if you have domain knowledge about the subject. For example, if the project involves home loan data, an understanding of the US real estate market, mortgage rate and default trends as well as general consumer sentiment will definitely help you create interesting questions
    -   You could potentially lose hours working on an analysis and then have your boss tell you that you misunderstood the request.
    -   You need to have a cursory understanding of the topic first. A limited and uncontextualized vocabulary does not do. It does only from the beginner or naive person. Development requires intimacy with topic. It coincides with contextual questions

-   DataFrame s have 3 components :
    -   values
    -   column index
    -   and row index
-   constraints - give the data structure - 3 concepts :
    -   1. **attribute constraints** e.g. data types on columns (chapter 2)
    -   2. **key constraints** e.g. primary keys(chapter 3)
    -   3. **referential integrity constraints** enforced through foreign keys(chapter 4) - a record referencing another table must refer to an existing record in that table
    -   special attribute constraints :
        -   not-null and unique constraints
        -   keys and superkeys
    -   keys
    -   referential integrity
-   SQL joins are based on a mathematical notion called cartesian products
-   ERD part 2 lucid chart : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CuY5ADwn24
    -   PK - FK - bridge table
    -   1 primary key per entity - unique - never changing - never null
    -   composite primary key : used when two or more attributes are necessary to uniquely indentify every record in the table
        -   this has something to do with relationship
-   should i learn web dev before data engineer - no
-   parallel computing : split task into subtasks -> distribute subtasks over several computers -> work together to finish task
-   cloud : storage - computation - database

-   data science = computer science + data mining
-   data mining = mining data to find insight(not finding data)
