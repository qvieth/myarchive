# jupyter notebook & ipython
## jupyter notebook & ipython
- __jupyter notebook__ is a popular product that __data scientists, analysts, and researchers__ use to analyze, store, and share work
- likewise, __ipython__ is an indispensable tool for conducting your data research and analysis
- let’s dive deep into jupyter notebooks and ipython to understand what makes them stand out from your __basic python interpreter__ 
 
### philosophy of a notebook
- good for doing __research__, include information about : 
    - __when__ you conducted this research
    - __which variables and data__ you used
    - __which steps and methods__ were used
    - and __what observations__ you may have had throughout the process
- __reproducibility__ is crucial for academics as well as those in practice
- by keeping a notebook, you and others can rerun work to get similar results and hopefully improve on the work. 
### jupyter notebook
- jupyter notebook is a powerful way to write and iterate on your python code for __data analysis__
- rather than writing and re-writing an entire program
- jupyter notebooks allow you to write code in separate blocks (or “cells”) and run each block of code individually
- then, if you need to make a change you can go back and make your edit and rerun the program again
- in addition to python code, jupyter notebook allows you to mix other programming languages 
- and rich text elements like mathematical equations, charts, hyperlinks, and stylized text
- this allows users to create polished, shareable outputs from analysis that may have taken multiple programs to accomplish previously. 


### ipython
- __ipython__ is a python interpreter that allows you to run python code within your terminal
- the basic python interpreter is very bare when it comes to handy helpers for coders
- the __ipython interpreter__ goes further by providing :
    - __run native shell commands__
    - syntax highlighting
    - tab completion
    - proper indentation
    - pasting blocks of code
    - and several features
- this is what makes ipython a welcoming alternative python interpreter and interactive shell used for computing in python


## setting up jupyter notebook
- what is a __python distribution__?
    - while python itself is just a programming language
    - a __python distribution__ bundles the __core language__ with various other __libraries__ and __packages__ 
    - the __standard python distribution__ is released on python.org and includes the python standard __library__ as well as the __package manager__ pip

- anaconda vs. miniconda :
    - miniconda = Python + __conda__
    - anaconda  = Python + __conda__ + meta package anaconda
    - the pre-installed packages from __meta pkg__ anaconda are mainly for __web scraping__ and __data science__
    - like __requests, beautifulsoup, numpy__, nltk, etc

> you do not need administrative or root permissions to install Anaconda if you select a user-writable install location.
