- arguing is about winning, debating is about __understanding__. So make it clear
- how emotion affect the way of thoughts, i now see similar between it and the marketing lesson where buyers are affected by emotion
- again, make it clear (everthing)
- make your point first, that's important, if they reject ask them for clarify, if they ask you to make your point clear, make it clear(again)
- keep learning, distinguish between academic vs applied method and knowledge: ex writing style
