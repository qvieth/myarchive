# functional programming

- [predicate](predicate)
- [recursion](recursion) :
- [reducer function](reducer-function)
- [currying](currying)
- [composition](composition)

## book : Learning React 2nd Edition Eve Porcello

- pure function
     - take at least 1 argument
     - return value computed from the argument
     - not change or mutate its arguments
- `Array.filter` takes a [predicate](predicate) as its only argument
- 2 core functions in order
     - to be proficient with functional programming:
          - `Array.map`
          - `Array.reduce`
- mdn : array.reduce
     - The reduce() method executes a [reducer function](reducer-function)
     - (that you provide) on each element of the array
     - resulting in a single output value
- [currying](currying)
- in functional programs
- we should use functions over values wherever possible

```javascript
React.createElement(type, props, children);
```
