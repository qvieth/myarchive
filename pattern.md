# pattern

- [design pattern](design-pattern)
- [OOS](OOS)

- [book : design pattern - GOF page 13]
- a pattern has four essential elements:
     1. pattern name : a handle to describe problem, solution and consequences in a word or two
     2. problem
     3. solution : non-concrete design or implementation, => abstract description
     4. consequences : results and trade-offs of applying pattern

> [Point of view](perspective) affects one's interpretation of what is and isn't a pattern. One
> person's pattern can be another person's primitive building block
