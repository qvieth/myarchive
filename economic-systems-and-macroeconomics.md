# economic systems and macroeconomics
- the invisible hand of the free market : the idea that individuals and businesses meet society's needs when they seek their own self-interest
- competitive markets with profit-seeking businesses will have an incentive to produce high quality products as efficiently as possible
- most modern economy are actually __mixed economy__ :
    - both free market : sell only what we want to buy, don't care about environment => lower cost
    - and government intervention : regulations for product to sell
- __circular flow model__ : a modern economy is made up of households and businesses
    - product market : where businesses sell goods and services to households in the product market
    - vs resource market : the household need to pay for these goods and services but where do they get the money : by selling the resources, like labor to businesses, now this is done in the resource market
    - this will get more complex when you add in international trade and the financial sector
    - but for now, the simplified __circular flow__ shows how the modern economy works

- thomas sowell : 'there are no solutions, only trade-offs'
- it would be great if we could end poverty and provide healthcare for everyone, but we're gonna have to give something up in order to do it
- forcing car producers to meet emissions and safety regulations will increase production costs and likely increase the price of cars
- but it also reduces pollution and fossil fuel consumption, which wil hopefully improve public health and save money in the long run
- there is always an opportunity cost
- it's vital for you to be informed about the merits and the limits of the economic systems
- and be willing to support solutions that get the job done, as opposed to getting stuck in one ideology
- economic theories and models can seem really great in the abstract, but when they're kicked out into the real world and actually have to govern the affairs of billions of people
- it turns out that some __flexibility__ is a very important thing

- Main outtakes of this lesson:
1. answer these 3 questions, you got a economic system
    - What will we produce?
    - How to produce it?
    - Who will get it?
2. Two different economic systems: market economies and planned economies
    a. In planned economy, government controls labor, land and capital
    b. Communism is primarily defined by the lack of private property. Class-lessness is a symptom of having no private property. There are no communist countries in the world.
    c. Often socialism has some private property and some public ownership.
    d. Command economy is totally controlled by government.
    f. In market economies, individuals control production to get profit.
- Invisible hand - the unintended social benefits resulting from individual actions.
- "It's not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from the regard to their own interest."
- The mechanism of the invisible hand is that if you produce unwanted or shoddy products, a competitor will produce better more desirable products and put you out of business. This results in businesses that produce the things that people want/demand most, at lower prices.
3. Modern economies are neither completely free market nor planned. There's a spectrum of government involvement.
4. Circular flow model.
    a. Modern economy is made above households (individuals like him and you) and businesses.
    b. Businesses sell goods and services to households in product market.
    c. Households earn the money by selling labor to businesses.
    d. Businesses pay for the resources on resource market.
    f. Government also buys products and resources, i.e. to buy cars from businesses and hire policemen to drive them.
    e. Government gets the money from taxes, households and businesses (and borrowing).
