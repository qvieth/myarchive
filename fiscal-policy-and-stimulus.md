- Main outtakes of this lesson
1. __Recessionary gap__ - a situation wherein the real GDP is lower than potential GDP at the full employment level
2. __Inflationary gap__ - the amount by which the actual gross domestic product (GDP) exceeds potential full-employment GDP
3. Macroeconomics - the study of the entire economy as a whole rather than individual markets
4. Fiscal policy -  the way a government adjusts its __spending levels__ and __tax rates__ to monitor and influence a nation's economy
    - Expansionary Fiscal Policy - stimulates the economy during or anticipation of a business-cycle contraction
    - Contractionary Fiscal Policy - enacted by a government to reduce the money supply and ultimately the spending in a country
    - Classical theories assumed that the economy will fix itself in a long run, and that government intervention will, at best, lead to unintended consequences and, at worst, cause massive inflation and debt
5. Deficit spending - the government spends more money than it collects in tax revenue
    - Crowding out - where increased public sector spending replaces, or drives down,  private sector spending
    - Keynesian economists maintain that crowding out is only a problem if economy operates at full capacity, where all workers are employed and we're producing as much as we can
6. Austerity - raising taxes and cutting government spending to reduce debt. In crisis of 2008 was main policy of EU
    - which led to worse results than deficit spending policy in US
7. Multiplier effect - the initial increase in government spending of 100 bucks might turn out to be 175$ worth of actual spending in the economy
    - When the economy is booming, multiplier is close to 1x
    - When economy is in recession, the multiplier is around 2x
    - Spending on infrastructure, and aid to state & local governments , also seems to have fairly high multiplier, about 1.5
    - But general cuts to payroll and income taxes seems to have a multiplier of about 1:
        - If the government cuts 100 bucks in taxes, the economy is going to grow by about 100 bucks
