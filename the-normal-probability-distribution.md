# the normal probability distribution

-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI5y3RZe9fk
-   aka normal distribution
-   completely defined by mean (\mu) and standard deviation(\sigma)
-   total area under the curve is 1
-   formula(or equation) for normal distribution

```
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac(x-\mu}^2{2 \sigma}^2)}
```

-   not use the formula much in statistics (or at least in introductory statistics)
    -   because in the back of the textbook
    -   you have a table of values that calculates
    -   the different values along this bell curve
-   usually we're intersted in area under the curve
-   it's turn out in later sections, we're gonna be very interested in finding the area under this curve
-   find area under the curve is to find the answer to the problems
-   if we didn't have the tables, we would have to calculate the area using actual formula and the way you do that has to do with calculus

*   for anywhere in the world and 99% of statistics classes
    -   **IMPORTANT** : what you're gonna end up doing is
        -   using the table of values in the back of your textbook
        -   to find the area under these bell(probabilities of outcomes)
