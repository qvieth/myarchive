## section 1.1 : getting started

-   not deductive reasoning - statistics is inductive reasoning -> therefor it's both science and mathematics
-   sample - subset of population
-   sample statistics - population parameters
-   venn diagram of target population - sampled population - sample
-   statistics : descriptions, characteristics of sample

*   2 branches of **statistics** :
    -   descriptive : gathers, sorts, summarizes and display data
    -   inferential : involves using descriptive statistics to estimate population parameters
*   2 types of **analysis** :
    -   exploratory analysis : uses data to estimate parameters
    -   confimatory analysis : uses statistics to test **claims about reality (hypotheses)**

## section 1.2 : data classification

-   classify data as :
    -   qualitative : aka categorical, labels, traits
    -   or quantitative : numeric, counts, measurements
        -   discrete data : particular values, counts, ratios of counts
        -   continuous data : any values, intervals, measurements
-   level of measurement :
    -   nominal --description
    -   ordinal --ordering
    -   interval --differences between levels
    -   ratio --true zero
-   data at nominal level of measurement are qualitative data consists of labels and names
-   data at ordinal level of measurement are qualitative data that can be arranged in a meaningful order, but calculations such as addition or division do not make sense
-   data at interval level of measurement are quantitative data that can be arranged in a meaningful order, and differences between data entries are meaningful
-   data at ratio level of measurement are quantitative data that can be ordered, differences between data entries are meaningful, and the **zero point indicates the absence of something**

## section 1.3 : the process of statistical study

-   conducting a statistical study :
    1. determine the design of the study : **most important step** -> remember your sample must be the representative of the population
        - state the question to be studied
        - determined the population and variables
        - determine the sampling method
    2. collect the data
    3. organize the data
    4. analyze the data to answer the question

*   the process of a statistical study :

    -   an **observational study** observes data that already exist
    -   an **experiment** generates data to help indentify cause-and-effect relationships

*   observational studies :
    -   **representative sample** : a representative sample has the same relevant characteristics as the population and does not favor one group from population over another
    -   note : a sample could be representative for one characteristic of the population(parameter) but not for another
    -   **important question** : all statistics are based on that sample you drawn and that sample has to be representative of the population
        -   so the question is : how do you know if a sample is representative of the population?

-   sampling techniques
    1. simple random sample :
        - every sample from the population has an equal chance of being selected
    2. stratified sameple :
        - population is divided into subgroups called strata
        - the grouping variables is correlated with the measurement variables
        - a sample is drawn from each stratum
    3. cluster sample :
        - the population is divided into subgroups, called clusters
        - the grouping variable is not correlated with the measurement variable
        - a sample is drawn from at least one of the clusters
    4. systematic sample :
        - selecting every nth member of the population
    5. convenience sample : never ever use this, **this is an unethical method to use**
        - the sample is convenient for the researcher to select
-   question : what is the primary difference between cluster and stratified sampling?
-   types of observational studies
    -   in a **cross-sectional study**, data are collected at a single point in time
    -   in a **longitudinal study**, data are gathered by following a particular group over a period of time

*   experiments :
    -   a **treatment** is some condition that is applied to a group of subjects in an experiment
    -   the **subjects (participants)** are people or things being studied in an experiment
    -   the **response variable** is the variable in an experiment that responds to the treatment (dependent)
    -   the **explanatory variable** is the variable in an experiment that causes the change in the response variable (independent)
* principles of experimental design :
    1. randomize the control and treatment groups
    2. control for outside effects on the response variable
    3. replicate the experiment a significant number of times to see meaningful patterns
* experiments :
    * control group : group of subjects to which no treatment is applied in an experiment
    * treatment group : is a group of subjects to which researchers apply a treatment in an experiment
    * cofounding variables : are unmeasured factors other than the treatment that cause an effect on the subjects of an experiment
* question : how do we know if there are cofounding variable in a statistical study?
* single blind experiment vs double blind experiment

- institutional review boards
    - an **institutional review board** (IRB) is a group of people who review the design of a study to make sure that it is appropriate and that no unneccessary harm will come to the subjects involved
    - **informed consent** involves completely disclosing to participants the goals and procedures involved in a study and obtaining their agreement to participate

## section 2.1 : frequency distributions
- **distribution** : a way to describe the structure of a particular data set or population
- **frequency** distribution is a display of the value that occur in a data set and how often each value or range of value occurs
- **frequencies** (f) : numbers of data values in the categories of a frequency distribution
- **class** : category of data in a frequency distribution
- **ordered array** : an ordered list of the data from largest to smallest or vice vesa
- **probability distribution** : a theoretical distribution used to predict the probabilities of particular data values occuring in a population
- **ungroup frequency distribution** : is a frequency distribution where each category or class represents a single value
- **grouped frequency distribution** : a frequency distribution where the classes are ranges of possible values

* to create an ungrouped frequency distribution :
    * determine the levels of the categorical variable
    * count the number of observed values in each level

- constructing a frequency distribution
- characteristic of a frequency distribution
    - class boundaries
    - class midpoint
    - relative frequency

## section 2.2 : graphical displays of data
- distinguish between the basic shapes of a distribution
- graphs :
    - should be bale to stand albone without the orginal data
    - must have labels
    - ...
- different types of bar graph
    - pie chart
