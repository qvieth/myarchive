# self expression

Do you ever stop to think about how you share yourself with others?

We all have our own unique quirks and traits, and we all have our own preferences and style for sharing pieces of ourselves with those around us.

You likely have a different level of sharing comfort with each person in your life—like a sort of security clearance in which those closest to you have a “Level 5” clearance while acquaintances have a “Level 1” clearance.

How we share and express ourselves to others forms the basis of our personality, as understood by everyone but us, and sets the tone for our entire lives. It’s a vital aspect of life to pay attention to, especially if you want to feel more understood and more in tune with the people you care about.

The way that we share ourselves is known as self-expression, and it turns out there are a lot of ways to do it. There are few “wrong” ways of expressing yourself, but there are some things you can do that give you a better chance of hearing and being heard than others.

## What is the Meaning of Self-Expression?

I think we all have a pretty good handle on what self-expression is, but let’s see how the experts define it:

> “We define self-expression as expressing one’s thoughts and feelings, and these expressions can be accomplished through words, choices or actions.” (Kim & Ko, 2007).

This is an intuitive definition—self-expression is, at its core, the action of expressing yourself, and it can take a wide variety of forms. You can use your words, your facial expressions, your body, your movements, clothing, actions, and possessions to express your authentic inner self.

Although the idea is simple, it seems that few fully grasp the importance of self-expression. We are all so bogged down with messages about how we should look, think, speak, and act; what we should eat and drink and study and do for fun; who we should associate with and who we should love or despise; and, indeed, who we should be deep down.

These constant missives about what we ought to do and who we ought to be can make it difficult to let go of expectations and simply be ourselves.

The last paragraph may have resonated with you—as it resonates with me—but as we’ll see later, the value we have for self-expression is not a universally shared value

## The Importance of Self-Expression

Related to our discussion above, the importance of self-expression will vary depending on your location and the culture you are steeped in. As the World Values Survey showed, individualism is not highly valued in many countries. This fact makes the sentence below—a pretty tame idea by Western standards—anything from mildly strange to outright laughable in another context.

> “The journey of self-discovery is the most important journey we can take” (De la Huerta, 2014).

In many cultures, a journey of self-discovery would be considered odd, unusual, a waste of time, or even selfish; the people might say something like, “Why spend your time and effort on getting to know yourself? Just ask your family—they’ll tell you exactly who you are!”

However, given the largely Western audience of positive psychology, we’ll focus on the importance of self-expression in this context.

De la Huerta’s (2014) article provides a good brief overview of why self-expression is so important in our society. He argues that self-expression is a vital piece of the puzzle that is fulfillment in life; it allows us to be our best selves, reach our full potential, and make valuable contributions to the world we live in.

Authentic self-expression is how we embrace who we are, all the way from the positive traits and acts we keep on the surface to the darker and less valued pieces of ourselves that we bury deep down.

> “Neuroscience is teaching us that ‘self-expression’ might be one – if not the most important ways for people to connect, navigate and grow with each other.” Judith Glaser

Research Judith Glaser agrees on the importance of self-expression; she notes that authentic self-expression not only encourages us to be the best we can be, it allows us to work effectively with others. When we open up and express ourselves, we move from what she calls a state of protection (coddling our ego and manning our inner walls to protect ourselves) to a state of partnering (being open to sharing yourself with others and vice versa).

According to Glaser, this state is where we get our best and most innovative work done. Acting in alignment with our authentic selves activates our prefrontal cortex, giving us greater access to our higher-order abilities like creative and innovative thinking, problem-solving, and planning.

Two artists and educators, Jay M. Hanes and Eleanor Weisman, agree that self-expression is not only important for our relationship with ourselves and our relationships with others, it’s also vital for our work. They propose that we learn about ourselves through expressing ourselves, reflecting on our core self and engaging in creative learning that will benefit us in all walks of life and all disciplines and industries (Hanes & Weisman, 2016).
