# Django - freecodecamp

- build web application
- comeback later : **focus on study Linux, how packages work, dependencies work, how to install any app and make it works**

- [academind - django course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7DrJqcUviA)
## what and why
- use django when :
     - we want to **focus on our core business logic**,
     - not on the nitty-gritty technical details of
     - handling requests and responses
- parsing requests, sending responses
- querying the database, working with data
- sessions, file uploads etc.
- course prerequisites
