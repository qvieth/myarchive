-
-   reserved words - dog - they only know certain words
-   sentences of lines - what's next
    -   assignment statement -> assignment with expression -> print statement
    -   variable - operator - constant - reserved word
-   programming in paragraph - statement
-   code a program that print 2
-   conditional step
-   repeated steps
-   i'm just trying to give you a big picture, next several chapter we're going to hit all of these again, in much more detail with alot more better information
-   show a hard program(have sequential, conditional, repeated step) and promise in the next several chapters they will know what it means
-   once again, don't worry too much about this, over the next couple weeks, we'll fill the pieces so that you absolutely understand every single line of this code
-   sumary :
    -   this is a quick overview of chapter 1
    -   we will revisit these concepts thoughout the course
    -   focus on the big picture : (show a picture of a beach, ask them what they see, the ability to skip all the detail, focus on the abstraction)

## mosh

-   i'll let you create tons of cool applications...
-   download python
-   what ever you want to do, you need addional courses

-   fundamentals concepts in programming :

1. variable
2. so we're going to write a small program that asks the user name then print their name customize for that user
    - input()
    - think of remote control, button is the function, using this function is like pressing button on the remote control
    - name = input('what is your name ')
    - print('hi')
    - you don't have to remember any function in this course, i will send you a cheat sheet

-   types : converse types
-   birth_year = input('birh year ')
-   age = 2019 - birth_year
-   print(age) -> error
-   -> typeError
-   explain 1992 is different than '1992'
-   int() , float(), bool()
-   challenge : ask user their weight, convert it to pounds and print on the terminal 1pound = 0.45 kg

## cs50

-   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9Eds2Rc_x8
-   variable
-   print(hello) wrong
-   print('hello')
-   open coding environment
-   print helloworld
-   explain each line
-   computer only understand 0 and 1
-   explain compiler
-   rule, syntax
-

## my slide
- focus improving visual aids and interaction

### what is programming (5 minutes)
- a question for you guys : how to drink water? -> google how to drink water 10s
- 30s -> wating for answer
- show video 1:20p
- now why i show you guys this video? -> so now you can think programming as drinking water
- drink water is a program, if you tell some person they may understand
- so think about the AI program, chuong trinh game, who are you talking to?
- yes, you're **talking to a computer**,
- ve ban chat cai dien thoai, nguoi may, may tinh deu la nhung cai may tinh, ve nguyen tac no se giong nhau, nhung neu em muon lap trinh nhung con AI, lap trinh game tren may PS4, xbox, VR, ban chat no se giong voi cai may tinh
- hay nho tat ca deu la cai may tinh
- so now we know the subject, how do you talk the program to it?
- we're going to use a languages, ngon ngu lap trinh minh se hoc la python

-   any one can learn python
-   i remember when i first learned, it went from me confused, confused, confused. and then one day, when they are all connected, you will shout out : 'awesome'
-   i expect that many of you will go through that same thing
-   so just learn the first parts, accept the fact that it doesn't nessarily make sense in a big picture
-   just bear with me okay?
-   python is one of the most popular programming languages outthere
-   everyday, people use it to do cool things like : Automation, AI, build applications, websites(instagram, dropbox)
-   at the end of this course, you will know how to build 1 mo hinh hoc may noi chuyen vs em

### python and its fundamentals (5 minutes)
- neu ban duoc hoc 1 mon ngon ngu moi thi day la 1 trong nhung tuc le ma ban se phai trai qua :'hello world'
- show them how to print hello world
- print('hello world') -> reverse engineer down all small detail of what you did -> show the remote control
- next variable -> bring a cup of water -> pull the water -> type the a = 'hello world' -> cai variable nay no dat biet o cho la neu ban muon doi no thanh mot gia tri khac, cai gia tri cu phai bi mat di

### write a small program (5 minutes)
1. show the picture of
2. greeting = 'hello'
3. print( hello ) -> wrong
4. print('hello')
5. show image of TV remote
6. show blackbox IO-> a more abstract form of the tv remote
7. \n
