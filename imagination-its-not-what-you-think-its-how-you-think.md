- in cognitive sciences :
    * we can see things we already know
    * and won't see things that we don't know
- but it points out this mental process, which is
    - out mind, our imagination
    * will pick out a bit of what we know
    * and will fill in the rest of the picture
- anthropology - sympathetic magic
- psychology - stereotype
- economics - representiveness
- daily life - it's remind me of..

- words evoke experience, not reality
- ourself- winner - loser - shy
- technologies and science advance as our instruments exceed our imagings
- and at that point it's time to reimagine the world
