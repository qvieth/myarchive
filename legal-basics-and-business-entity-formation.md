# legal basics and business entity formation
- sole proprietorship : you own the business, your assets like house, car can be seized
- silent partner?
- partnership :
    - general partnership : you and one or more partners share personal liability and all have an equal say when making decisions
    - limited partnership : someone takes on __unlimited liability__, so their personal assets can be seized in a legal battle, and they have to pay self-employment taxes
    - limited liability partnership(LLP) : everyone gets limited liability. it's more work to form than a general partnership, and gives less protection than fancier business structure. but it does give owners at least some liability protection
    - overall, partnerships -- especially LPs and LLPs -- are more expensive than sole proprietorships because they need more legal and accounting help
- corporation : sometimes called C-corp : an entity that's completely separate from its owner
    - like a person, a corporation can have profits, taxes and liability 
    - Ccorp can have many benefits comparing to others, but for all of these benefits, you have to be ready to hustle
    - any type of corporation needs a giant pile of state and federal paperwork to form
    - they require extensive record-keeping, operational processes, and annual reports on their activities to the government
    * ccorp are also expensive to form
    - and unlike sole proprietorship and partnerships, ccorp pay tax on profits before handing money out to stockholders 
- non-profit
