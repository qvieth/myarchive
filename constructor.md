# constructor
- [subroutine](subroutine)
- a special type of subroutine called to create an object
- It prepares the new object for use
- often accepting arguments that the constructor uses
- to set required member variables
- A constructor resembles an instance method
- but it differs from a method in that
     - it **has no explicit return type**
     - it is **not implicitly inherited**
     - and it usually has different rules for scope modifiers
