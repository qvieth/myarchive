# currying

- [wiki : currying]()
- currying is the technique of
     - converting a function that takes multiple arguments into
     - a sequence of functions that each takes a single argumen
- x=f(a,b,c) becomes :
     - h = g(a)
     - i = h(b)
     - x = i(c)
- or called in sequence :
     - x=g(a)(b)(c)
