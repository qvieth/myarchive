# probabilities of probabilities 3B1B
- to be explained :
    
# 1. binomial distributions
- set up the model
- and start by talking about the binomial distribution
- How to read rating :
    - pretend you see two more reviews : 1 positive, 1 negative
    - then compute the new probabilities
    - => **Laplace's rule of succession**
- and to understand what assumptions are underlying this
- and how changing either those assumptions or your underlying goal
- can change the choice you make
- we really need to go through all the math
- step 1 :
    - how exactly are we modeling the situation
    - and what exactly is it that you want to optimize?
        - 


# 2. bayesian updating, probability density functions
- bring in ideas of bayesian updating
- and how to work with probabilities over continuous values
# 3. beta distribution
- we'll look at something known as a Beta distribution
- and pull up a little python to analyze the data we have
- and come to various different answers depending on
- what it is you want to optimize
