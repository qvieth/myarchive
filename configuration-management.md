# configuration management

## [CM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management) : configuration management in : 
- __system engineering__ process
- ITSM process

## [system engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) 
- interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management, focus on design, integrate, and manage __complex system__
- Systems engineering techniques are used in complex projects :
    - spacecraft design
    - computer chip design
    - robotics
    - software integration
    - and bridge building
    - etc..
- __systems engineering__ uses a host of tools that include __modeling__ and __simulation__, __requirements analysis__ and __scheduling__ to __manage complexity__

[complex system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) : a system composed of many components which may interact with each other

## [ITIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL) : information technology infrastructure library
- __a set of best and detailed practices__ of axelos for __IT service management (ITSM)__ that focuses on aligning __IT services__ with the __needs of business__
- can think this as a framework

## [ITSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_service_management) : IT service managerment : Differing from network management and IT systems management
- __activities__ that are performed by an organization to __design, plan, deliver, operate__ and __control__ IT services __offered to customers__
- IT service management focusing on customer needs and IT services for customers rather than __IT systems__, and stressing continual improvement
- business uses ITSM mostly in support of __customer experience__ and __service quality__
- ITSM has ties and common interests with other IT and general management approaches, __information security__ management and __software engineering__ 
- framework for itsm : etom, cobit, fitsm, mof
- tools : workflow management system, configuration management database (CMDB)
> differ from [network management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_management) and [IT systems management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_management)

### configuration management database (CMDB)
- commonly referred to as Configuration Items (CI)
- an ITIL database used by an organization to store information about __hardware__ and __software__ assets 
- This database acts as a __data warehouse__ for the organization 
- and also stores __information__ regarding the __relationships__ among __its assets__
- The CMDB stores __organization's critical assets__ and __their relationships__ :
        - information systems
        - upstream sources 
        - __dependencies of assets__
        - and the downstream targets of assets

```
    - According to VeriSM(TM), an asset is defined as anything that is useful or valuable within a product or service
        This value is generally determined financially: how much an asset costs versus how much it saves
    - ITIL defines a configuration item (CI) as any component that must be managed in order to deliver an IT service
```

## [network management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_management) and [IT systems management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_management)
- Network management is the process of administering and managing __computer networks__ 
- Systems management refers to __enterprise-wide__ administration of __distributed systems__ including __computer systems__
- Systems management is strongly influenced by network management
