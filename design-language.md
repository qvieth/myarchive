- A design language or is an overarching scheme or style
- that **guides the design** of a complement
     - of products
     - or architectural settings
- objective :
     - give their suite of products a **unique but consistent** look and feel define a specification for it
     - describe choices for design aspects such as materials, colour schemes, shapes, patterns, textures, or layouts
     - Usually, design languages are not rigorously define
          - the designer basically makes one thing in a similar manner as another
     - In other cases, they are followed strictly
          - so that the products gain a strong thematic quality
     - For example, although there is a great variety of unusual chess set designs
          - the pieces within a set are usually thematically consistent
     - Sometimes, designers encourage others to follow their design languages when decorating or accessorizing
