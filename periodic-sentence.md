# [periodic sentence](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/periodic_sentence.htm)

A periodic sentence is a sentence that has been deliberately structured to place the main point at the end.
Therefore, a periodic sentence will have its main clause or predicate as the last part.

Usually, a periodic sentence will be a busy sentence.
Often, the very last word in the sentence will be the point the writer wants to emphasize.

Example :
- When I was shopping in the town yesterday, **I saw Mike!**
- Despite the blinding snow, the freezing temperatures, and the heightened threat of attack from polar bears, **the team continued.**

Compare the last example above to this:
- I saw Mike when I was shopping in the town yesterday!

(This is not a periodic sentence. It is far less impactful and has far less shock value. The main point is not delivered like a punchline.)

Periodic sentences are mostly used to **emphasize**, to **shock**, or to create **suspense.**
Periodic sentences can also be more persuasive than normal sentences as they allow
a writer to put all the reasoning or evidence up front before making the final point.

Example :
- The winner of best city, with a mile-long modern shopping mall, cycle paths hugging every road, and a network of canals, **is Milton Keynes.**

	(Here, all the reasoning is put up front before the main information is given.)

- With two raw blisters and now unable to carry my pack due to two broken ribs and broken collar bone, I stared at my dead phone **pleadingly.**

	(This example ends not only with the idea (shaded) the writer wants to emphasize but also with the most important word (bold).)
