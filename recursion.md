# recursion

- a technique that involves creating functions
     - that recall themselves
- Often, when faced with a challenge that involves a loop
     - a recursive function can be used instead
- Recursion is a pattern that works
     - particularly well with asynchronous
- Functions can recall themselves when theyâ€™re ready
     - like when the data is available
     - or when a timer has finished processes
- think of recursion at the word 'until', 'repeated'
