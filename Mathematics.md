* PRICIPLE OF PROBLEM SOLVING :
    1. understand the problem
    2. introduce notation
    3. state what is given
    4. identify the unknown
    5. connect the unknown with the given
```

- [Q: How can something be “proven” in science or math?](https://www.askamathematician.com/2017/08/q-how-can-something-be-proven-in-science-or-math/)
    - think maths as chess
    - rules in mathematics are called **axioms** - (similar to laws in physics)
    - results based on those rules are **theorems**
    - proofs in math similar to hypothesis testing in scientific inquiry
* MATH IS A LANGUAGE : => think about how you use dictionary to search words
- A formular :
    - -> whether it is truth (so that it can be used or not)?
    - -> if it is true, then it can be use for **solving problems**
* **STUDY MATH FROM THE BIG IDEAS or FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM DOWN**
* **numerically** vs geometrically
    * focus on **numerically ideas** then reverse engineer down from the **numericallly ideas**
