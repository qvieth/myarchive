- Math is about **REFRAMING THE PROBLEMS**

* **MATH IS A LANGUAGE : => think about how you use dictionary to search words

* 'Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things'
* “Mathematicians prepare abstract reasoning that’s ready ‘to be used’ even though they don’t know what it’s being used for”

    * Conclusion

* [ ] logarithms, exponential, complex number
* Computation is a subgroup of math
    * where you have to create ways to solve math in an efficient way
    * You can have algebraic computation, numeric computation statistical computation...
    * and a good computation involves math in every step of the algorithm 
    * even when you have verbose computation * since all is translated to machine code etc...
