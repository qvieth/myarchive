    * Conclusion

* Computation is a subgroup of math
    * where you have to create ways to solve math in an efficient way
    * You can have algebraic computation, numeric computation statistical computation...
    * and a good computation involves math in every step of the algorithm 
    * even when you have verbose computation
    * since all is translated to machine code etc...
