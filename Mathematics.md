    - Conclusion

- Computation is a subgroup of math
    - where you have to create ways to solve math in an efficient way
    - You can have algebraic computation, numeric computation statistical computation...
    - and a good computation involves math in every step of the algorithm 
    - even when you have verbose computation
    - since all is translated to machine code etc...
- So the right question could be:
    - Is math the software of this universe?
    - If it's the software, the hardware is pure energy
    - that is molded according to the software instructions
    - When we will be able to compute LIFE into equations
    - the software will be so complex that no human will understand
    - Nor the machine that will find them in 100 years
    - in a machine 1 million times faster than the human brain
