## big ideas, great insight :
- MATH IS ABOUT **REFRAMING THE PROBLEMS**
* MATH IS A LANGUAGE : => think about how you use dictionary to search words
* **STUDY MATH FROM THE BIG IDEAS DOWN**

* [ ] logarithms, exponential, complex number
* Computation is a subgroup of math
    * where you have to create ways to solve math in an efficient way
    * You can have algebraic computation, numeric computation statistical computation...
    * and a good computation involves math in every step of the algorithm 
    * even when you have verbose computation * since all is translated to machine code etc...
