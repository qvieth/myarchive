 logic is reasonable

```from precalculus - james stewart - prologue P3
* PRICIPLE OF PROBLEM SOLVING :
    1. understand the problem
    2. introduce notation
    3. state what is given
    4. identify the unknown
    5. connect the unknown with the given
```

-   How much maths knowledge do you need to be a database administrator?
    -   You need to understand the basics of discrete math, relational theory, and some parts of the set theory. Your goal should be to have a very good grasp of:
        1. set theory
        2. relational operations
        3. math behind normalization
        4. boolean and propositional logic
        5. Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus
-   loop : thik of mathematical induction(sequences) with pre and post conditions
    -   a_n = frac{-1^n}{n+1} for every interger n \geq 0
    -   -> BIG IDEA : THINK OF THE FORMULA FIRST, NOT THE FOR FIRST
-   mathematical induction is actually deduction process - has to make sure the observation true for all statement -> form an axiom for reasoning

```
¬(∃xP(x))=∀x(¬P(x))
```

-   three of the most important kinds of sentences in mathematics :
    -   universal statement (“all are”)
    -   existential statement ("exist") -> this is negation of \forall
    -   conditional ("if then")
-   review -> and <->
-   The symbol ... is called an ellipsis and is read “and so forth”
-   [Q: How can something be “proven” in science or math?](https://www.askamathematician.com/2017/08/q-how-can-something-be-proven-in-science-or-math/)
    -   think maths as chess
    -   rules in mathematics are called **axioms** - (similar to laws in physics)
    -   results based on those rules are **theorems**
    -   proofs in math similar to hypothesis testing in scientific inquiry

2.  IMPORTANT : combination = permutation devided by `number of ways that you can arrange k people`
3.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#/media/File:Argument_terminology_used_in_logic_(en).svg
4.  There are two aspects to mathematics - discovery and proof
5.  For every k, if P1 k2 is true, then P1 k  12 is true
    -   mathematical induction - induction step - sequence chapter
6.  mathematics is about modeling (get this ideas from reading precalculus)
7.  http://www.corestandards.org/Math/ | http://www.corestandards.org/other-resources/key-shifts-in-mathematics/
8.  MATH IS A LANGUAGE : => think about how you use dictionary to search words
9.  **STUDY MATH FROM THE BIG IDEAS or FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM DOWN**
10.  **numerically** vs geometrically
    -   focus on **conceptual/geometric ideas** then reverse engineer down to the **numerical formular**
