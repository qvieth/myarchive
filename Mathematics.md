    - Conclusion

- Computation is a subgroup of math
    - where you have to create ways to solve math in an efficient way
    - You can have algebraic computation, numeric computation statistical computation...
    - and a good computation involves math in every step of the algorithm 
    - even when you have verbose computation
    - since all is translated to machine code etc...
