# crash course physics
- AP Physics 1&2 - physics rule book
- time, position, velocity, acceleration - how they all work together

## **1. Motion in a straight line
- kinematic equation
- velocity :            |**change in**| position over change in time
- acceleration :        |**change in**| velocity over change in time
- difference(change in ..) = greek letter `delta`

- Kinematics equations :
    1. the difinition of acceleration :
```
this wil be used a lot
average v = v0 + at
```

    1. the displacement curve

## **2. Derivatives
- velocity          |is the derivative of|      position
- acceleration      |is the derivative of|      velocity

## 3. Integrals
inverse of derivatives
- position          |is the integral of|      velocity
- velocity          |is the integral of|      acceleration
- C : constant

## 4. Vector & 2D motion

## 5. Newton's law
- newton's three laws
- how inertia works
- fnet=ma
- equilibrium
- normal force
- tension force

## 6. Friction
- kinetic and static friction
- friction to describe object's motion
- normal force on an incline

## 7. Uniform circular motion
- the story of newton
- kepler's three law
- gravitational acceleration on mars

## 8. Newtonian Gravity

## 9. Work, energy and power
- describing work
- energy is the ability to do work
- kinetic and potential energy
- non-conservative vs conservative systems
- two different equations for power
