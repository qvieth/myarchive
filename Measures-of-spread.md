# Measures of spread
- statistical measures of spread or dispersion tell us how data is spread around the middle
- that lets us know how well the mean or median represents the data
- interquartile range (IQR) : doesn't consider extreme value, the iqr looks at the spread of the middle 50% of your data
- variance : which can give us a better sense of how spread out the whole dataset is
- N and (N-1) for sample variance
- standard deviation : the average amount we expect a point to differ (or deviate) from the mean
