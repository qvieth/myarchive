# function

- [functional programming](functional-programming)

---

- Functions were **originally** the idealization of how
     - a varying quantity depends on another quantity
     - y = f(x) : y is the function of x
     - the position of earth is the function of time
- until the 19th century, the functions that were considered
     - were differentiable
          - (that is, they had a high degree of regularity)
     - The concept of a function was formalized
          - at the end of the 19th century in terms of set theory
          - and this greatly enlarged the domains of application
          - of the concept
- Intuitively, a function is a process that associates
     - each element of a set X, to a single element of a set Y
- The fact of f being a function from the set X to the set Y
     - is formally denoted by `f : X â†’ Y`
