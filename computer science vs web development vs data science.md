# computer science vs web development vs data science
they are all overlapped in some places - programming
## how to consider path
- begin with the end goal in mind
- what your strength are as a programmer
- what kinds of __business problems__ do you want to tackle :
    - __web development__ : can be very rewarding to see your features and interfaces come to life, a web developer can help business by building their online presence and build digital equivalent of the store - if you enjoy building things
    - __data scientice__ : it can be very challenging to explore high level problems and ride the rapid of data mining, you get to ask big question and test hypothesis which can have lasting impacts, help a business with decisions like suggesting which products the store carries, which ones are hits or duds, where are the best place to put those products and even how long a store should be open - doing research, science
    - __computer science__ : help a business grow and scale as a computer scientist, you get to trailblaze paths and solve mission critical problems blocking business from growing to its true potential, a computer scientist could help a business by creating a stress-free customer experience making sure there's the right inventory for the right reason and even smoothing out purchases and return without any hassle - solving thought experiment

- where do you want to work + what kind of work you want to do :
- different company at different stage growth may treat each of these discipline differently :
    - a start-up may not have data for data scientist to use
    - a boutique design agency may not ever need one true computer scientist because they're making marketing websites
    - a large consulting firm may specialize in big data for its client and only need a handful of web developers but dozens of data scientists and computer scientists

### computer science - solve business problem with computer
- computation and solution complexity
- probability theory and forms
- data structures & __algorithm(just a fancy way of saying instruction)__
- software design pattern and principles
- funcional programming or OOP
- databases and testing
- operating systems and scripting

### data science - solve business problem with data
- convergence of data statistical and business
- python and R
- machine learning
- model evaluation
- feature engineering
- data modeling & processing
- algorithms and logarithms/exponents
- probability, statistics and mathematical solutions
- graph, plots and histograms


- data science is a broad field with wide set of tools to accomplish the goals so this is hardly an extensive list
- data scientists use a combination of programming statistics and business acumen to make suggestions about how to solve business problems
- they work closely with their co-workers to determine problems they didn't know existed or clarify relationships that can be leverage for better outcomes

### web development
- building, implementing the decisions made at higher levels
- creates intergrates and deploys the features that were decided upon
- 2 discipline many developers focus on :
[front-end vs back-end](front-end vs back-end)
