# what is finance?
```
- CFA
this is a really difficult exam
that a lot of people have to go into if they're
financial analysts
```
- do 3 things :
    - be disciplined
    - plan ahead
    - diversify
- these will go a long way toward helping you achieve material comfort and financial security
- start saving now
- invest in stocks through ETFs or index funds
- they give me diversification and they don't cost much

## some common careers
- personal financial advisor
- financial manager
- financial analyst
## salary
- around 55,000 dollar a year in the first 5 years after graduating and nearly 100,000 after 10 years or more on average
## satisfaction
- percent of employees that are satisfied with their job
## demand
## x-factor
- most people don't even start thinking about retirement or saving money instead of just spending it
- if you start investing in your 20s, you're way way way ahead of the curve
- if you're salesman, for instance, you don't want to work in a dying industry
- if you're in sales, you want to work in technology, finance
- you want to be selling maybe life insurance
- something along those lines
- because there's just so much more opportunity and industries that are booming
- if you go into a dying industry just about everything is going to be worse
- your salary is going to be lower
- you're goiung to be worked really hard
- and you're not going to be properly compensated for it
- your job satisfaction is also going to be very low
- just because of the fact that the company is constantly going to be trying to find ways to cut money
- so overall going into the finance industry is fantastic
- so that's going to factor into this score a little bit
- another thing to think about is whether something is future proof or not
