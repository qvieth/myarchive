# Data visualization part1&2
## Part 1
- Earlier in the series, i talked about how it can be hard to wrap your head around numbers
    - especially when they get really big or really small
- __frequency table__ : best way to display __categorical data__
    - __bar charts__ :
        - uses the frequencies that we saw in our frequency table
            - to create bars that have a height equal to the frequency 
            - that way, we can compare the height of bar instead of looking at raw number
        - display a lot of information in a very simple graph
        - they can also display the frequencies of multiple variables
        - when there're more then 1 variable : use stacked or double bar
    - __pie charts__ :
        - another way to display __categorical data__ 
        - are not good at displaying more than 1 variable
    - __pictograph__ :
        - another way to display categorical data
        - represent frequency with pictures
- __bin frequency table__ : distored by __re-binning__
    - __binning__ : a process takes a quantitative variable and bins it into categories that are either pre-existing or made up
- __histograms__, like bar charts
    - the height of the bars tell us how frequently data in a certain range occur
    - a historgram also give us information about __how the data is distributed__
    - histogram give us more information about the data than the __frequency table__ does,
    - but they're still obscuring what the specific data values are 

## Part 2
- __dotplot__ : historgram but replace with dot
- __stem and leaf plot__ : cousin of dotplot : use value from raw data instead of dots
- cumulative frequency plots
- Two-way tables organize data based on __two categorical variables__
