# Data visualization part1&2
- Earlier in the series, i talked about how it can be hard to wrap your head around numbers
    - especially when they get really big or really small
- __bar charts__ display a lot of information in a very simple graph
    - they can also display the frequencies of multiple variables
    - when there're more then 1 variable : use stacked or double bar
- __pie charts__ are not good at displaying more than 1 variable
- __bin frequency table__ : distored by __re-binning__
- in __histograms__, like bar charts
    - the height of the bars tell us how frequently data in a certain range occur
    - a historgram also give us information about __how the data is distributed__
- __dotplot__ : historgram but replace with dot
- __stem and leaf plot__ : cousin of dotplot : use value from raw data instead of dots
- cumulative frequency plots
- Two-way tables organize data based on __two categorical variables__
