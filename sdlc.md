# what is sdlc?
- software development life cycle (sdlc) is a __process__ used by the software industry to __design__, __develop__ and __test__ high quality softwares
- sdlc is a framework __defining tasks__ performed at each step in the software development process.

# stages of sdlc
## stage 1: planning and requirement analysis
- __requirement analysis__ is the __most__ important and fundamental stage in sdlc
- it is performed by the __senior members__ of the team with inputs from the customer, the sales department, market surveys and domain experts in the industry
- this information is then used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas
- planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the risks associated with the project is also done in the planning stage
- the outcome of the technical feasibility study is to define the various technical approaches that can be followed to implement the project successfully with minimum risks

## stage 2: defining requirements
- the next step is to clearly __define__ and __document__ the product __requirements__ and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts
- this is done through an __software requirement specification(srs)__ document consists all the __product requirements__ to be designed and developed during the sdlc

## stage 3: designing the product architecture
- srs is the reference for __product architects__
- based on the requirements in srs and documented in  __design document specification(dds)__
- this dds is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various __parameters__ as __risk assessment__, __product robustness__, __design modularity__, __budget__ and __time constraints__, the best design approach is selected for the product
- a __design approach__ clearly defines all the __architectural modules__ of the product along with its __communication__ and __data flow__ representation with the external and third party modules (if any)
- the internal design of all the modules of the __proposed architecture__ should be clearly defined with the minutest of the details in __dds__

## stage 4: building or developing the product
- in this stage of sdlc the __actual development starts__ and the product is built
- the programming code is generated as per dds during this stage
- if the design is performed in a detailed and organized manner, code generation can be accomplished without much hassle
- developers must follow the __coding guidelines__ defined by their organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code
- different high level programming languages such as c, c++, pascal, java and php are used for coding
- the programming language is chosen with respect to the type of software being developed
## stage 5: testing the product
- this stage is usually a __subset__ of __all the stages__ as in the modern sdlc models, the __testing activities__ are __mostly involved in all the stages of sdlc__
- however, this stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where product __defects__ are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, __until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the srs__
## stage 6: deployment in the market and maintenance
- once the product is tested and ready to be __deployed__ it is released formally in the appropriate market
- the product may first be released in a limited segment and tested in the real business environment (__uat- user acceptance testing__)
- then based on the feedback, the product may be released as it is or with suggested enhancements in the targeting market segment
- after the product is released in the market, its __maintenance__ is done for the existing customer base

# sdlc models
- each __sdlc model__ follows a __series of steps__ unique to its type to ensure success in the process of software development
- following are the most important and popular sdlc models followed in the industry âˆ’
    - waterfall model
    - iterative model
    - spiral model
    - v-model
    - big bang model
- others methodologies : rad model, rapid application development Agile, Lean, Iterative, Prototyping,DevOps,Spiral
