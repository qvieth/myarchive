# usecase
- A use case describes how a user uses a __system__ to accomplish a particular __goal__
- A use case diagram consists of
    - the system
    - the related use cases
    - and actors
- and relates these to each other
- to visualize:
    - what is being described? (system)
    - who is using the system? (actors)
    - and what do the actors want to achieve? (use cases)
- thus, use cases help ensure that the correct system is developed by capturing the requirements from the user's point of view
- A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify and organize system requirements
