# algorithms
- any well-defined computational procedure that
    - takes some value, or set of values as **input**
    - and produce some value, or set of values as **output**
    - an algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output
- we can also view an algorithm as a tool for
    - solving a well-specified **computational problems**
    - specifies/describes procedures as input/output relationship
- Which algorithm is best for a given application depends onâ€”among other factors
    - the number of items to be sorted
    - the extent to which the items are already somewhat sorted
    - possible restrictions on the item values
    - the architecture of the computer
    - and the kind of storage devices to be used: main memory, disks, or even tapes 
- **FOCUS ON TECHNIQUES OF ALGORITHM DESIGN AND ANALYSIS**
