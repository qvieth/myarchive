# category theory
-
- problem -> contentualize -> contextualize
-> reformulate problem -> find relevant categorical requirements
-> solve problem -> (reinterpret significance of the result)

- since category is a graph with an algebra of paths
- a functor should be a graph morphism which respects the algebra of paths
- functor(construction ) = graph morphism + preservation of paths
- a category is a context where relations between objects are the morphisms
- so a functor is a construction of new context or a recontextualization of old context

    1. what is category theory
    2. objects and morphisms
    3. the principle of sameness
    4. universal properties
1. category theory
    - category theory : mathematics of mathematics
    - mathematics : logical study of how logical things work
2. objects and morphisms
    - a category consists of :
        - some objects A,B,C,...
        - some morphisms (arrows) A -> B
        - composition and identities
        - associativity and unit laws
