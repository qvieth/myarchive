# category theory
-
- problem -> contentualize -> contextualize
-> reformulate problem -> find relevant categorical requirements
-> solve problem -> (reinterpret significance of the result)

- since category is a graph with an algebra of paths
- a functor should be a graph morphism which respects the algebra of paths
- functor(construction ) = graph morphism + preservation of paths
- a category is a context where relations between objects are the morphisms
- so a functor is a construction of new context or a recontextualization of old context

- plan :
    1. what is category theory
    2. objects and morphisms
    3. the principle of sameness
    4. universal properties
1. category theory
    - category theory : mathematics of mathematics
    - mathematics : logical study of how logical things work
2. objects and morphisms
    - a category consists of :
        - some objects A,B,C,...
        - some morphisms (arrows) A -> B
        - composition and identities
        - associativity and unit laws

    - our tools for describing things : composition - abstraction - identity
    - compostion and identity they just define category theory
    - category is bunch of objects | objects just identify the end of arrow(functions) - they don't serve other purpose
    * different composition table give you different categories
    * objects and arrows don't have structure, they don't contain information, their composition contain information
    - things are chopable
    - sets and functions between sets
    - think of the 2 square image and the arrows
