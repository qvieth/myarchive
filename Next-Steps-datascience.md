Congratulations on finishing the Data Scientist Career Path! What will you do next?

## Path Review
- Wow, you've learned a lot!
- At this point, you have the technical skills, knowledge, and resources you need to get your start as a data scientist.
- You are now able to:
    - [ ] Create programs using Python 3
    - [ ] Move off of the Codecademy platform with the Command Line, Jupyter Notebook, Git, and GitHub Desktop
    - [ ] Acquire and query data with SQL and BeautifulSoup
    - [ ] Manipulate data using NumPy and pandas
    - [ ] Wrangle and tidy data with pandas
    - [ ] Summarize and analyze data with scikit-learn
    - [ ] Implement many different hypothesis tests using Python
    - [ ] Visualize data using Matplotlib and seaborn
    - [ ] Communicate data science findings effectively
    - [ ] Work with text data using natural language processing
    - [ ] Build, train, and test a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models
    - [ ] Understand the fundamentals of deep learning
    - [ ] Work with aggregate functions and joins in SQL
- Plus, you now have several portfolio projects that showcase what you’ve learned in this Career Path and can share these projects with your community and future employers
- Once again, congratulations on finishing a challenging learning journey! We hope that you continue to build on your skills for years to come.

## What will you do next?
- Now that you have finished your learning journey, you may be asking, “What’s next?”
- Here are our recommendations for next steps:
    1. __Deep Learning__
        - Many data scientists include deep learning as a tool in their toolkit for __building, training, and testing__ models
        - We recommend getting started with either [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
        - We also have a forthcoming Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow Skill Path (keep an eye out!)
    2. __Big Data__
        - Big data is all about processing giant quantities of data
        - If this interests you, you may want to check out some common tools for this field, including [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), [Spark](https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/), and [H2O](https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/)
    3. __Natural Language Processing__
        - You’ve already gotten started with NLP, but there is still more to learn
    4. __Data Science Events__
        - Events give you a chance to connect with other data scientists and learn about the latest topics in the field
        - There are a lot of events out there including PyData, rstudio, Data Science Salon, PyCon, The Data Science Conference
            - and the list goes on! You can also join or create a Codecademy meetup to connect with other new data scientists
