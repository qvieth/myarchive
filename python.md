    -   chapter 1 : what is computation
        -   fixed program computer - stored program computer
        -   computer architecture : cpu - memory - i/o
        -   turing showed that you can compute anything using 6 primitives : move left, move right, read, write, scan and do nothing
        -   modern programming langueges have more convinient set of primitives
        -   can abstract methods to create primitives
        -   python rules:
            1. everything is an object
            2. every object has an type
            3. object can be converted from one type to another
            4. expressions : combination of objects and operators - has a value - which has a type
                - syntax for expression : `<object> <operator> <object>`
    -   chapter 2 : branching and interation
        -   control flow - branching - `<condition>` has a True of False value
            -   if `<condition>`:
                -   `<expression>`
                -   ...
            -   else :
                -   `<expression>`
                -   ...
    -   chapter 3 : string mainpulation, guess and check , approximations, bisection
    -   chapter 4 : decomposition, abstraction and functions
        -   decomposition idea : different devices work together to achieve an end goal
        -   reuseable pieces/chunks of code, called functions
        -   functions are not run in a program until they are called or invoked
        -   functions' characteristics : name(parameter) - scope - docstring + body - return something - function definition and function call
    -   chapter 6 : **recursion** and dictionaries
    -   chapter 7 : testing, debuggin, exceptions and assertions
        -   test case - input - output specification
        -   3 kinds :
            -   unit testing
            -   regression testing
            -   inegration testing
            -   black box testing
            -   glass box testing
