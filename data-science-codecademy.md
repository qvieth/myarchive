    - In general, unless you are doing NLP or computer vision, __Deep learning is NOT the algorithm youâ€™d want to use__
    - You can either take my word for it, or you can find out for yourself

# Build Deep Learning Models with Tensorflow
## path description
## vocab
- etl : extract, transform, load of data
- [data warehouse](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/what-is-a-data-warehouse/)
- data ware house and business intelligence solutions
- api - interface = protocol = abstraction - how to use/communicate without knowing the low level details of the implementation = quite similar to protocol
    - user interface vs application prograrm interface = user vs programmer
    - api make your life easier by giving you access the data and by providing you with an abstraction of the implementation
    - save you from needing to create everything yourself
    - these days, the term api is almost always used as a way to explain web-based apis
    - web-based apt - rest api - connect over http
- ml is about helping making predictions
- syllabus
- [build machine learning model with python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/machine-learning) : should find a book about this
- [Learn Statistics with Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-statistics-with-python)
- feature engineering - feature
- loss - error : minimize loss - minimize error : chance of wrong prediction
- machine learning : learning algorithm
- deep learning vs machine learning(or older learning algorithm)
- __loosely__ speaking
- [usecase](usecase) : what is [ML's usecase](https://algorithmia.com/blog/machine-learning-use-cases), DS's usecase, backend usecase,... google
- [model](model) :
- [dataset](dataset)
- sitemap
- data model : which is a kind of blueprint that defines and describes the structure of the data
- data point
- modeling performance
- data base vs dataset : databases are organized, also it's the place to hold dataset, the rest is quite the same
- query results vs schema
