# calculus
- calculus is also incredibly useful once you get past the basics
    - Especially in physics (which is what I’m doing rn)
    - it’s an incredibly powerful tool to describe
    - how things behave, allowing conclusions
    - that would be totally impossible
    - or incredibly difficult to demonstrate
    - through algebra or geometry
- IMPLICIT EQUATION? -> IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION
- prerequisites :
    - [What to know before taking calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-limits-new/ap-ab-about/a/ap-calc-prerequisites)
- the easy way to understand derivative is to understand velocity
```
1/infinity can be use to find area => integral => just multiplication
1/infinity can be use to find slope/gradient => derivative => just division
```
- calculus : infinitesimal : limit : method of exhaustion : approach : the mathmetics of things that __change__
