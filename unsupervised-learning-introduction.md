# Unsupervised learning introduction 
- Now that you’ve gotten a handle on some common supervised machine learning techniques
- it’s time to tackle some common applications of unsupervised machine learning
- The goal of this unit is to learn how to build machine learning models that can recognize patterns using unlabeled data
- After this unit, you will be able to:
    - Apply K-Means and K-Means++ Clustering to build an unsupervised classifier
    - Understand Hierarchical Clustering
    - Leverage Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of your dataset
    - Use clustering to identify patterns in data from a masculinity survey
