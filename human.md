-   [the power of vulnerability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o)
    -   why we're living is about connection
    -   connection = shame and fear
        -   shame : fear of disconnection
        -   is there something about me that
            -   if other people know it or see it
            -   i won't be worthy of connection
        -   the less you talk about it, the more you have it
        -   i don't ... enough
        -   the thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability
    -   shame all boils down to
    -   one variable that seperated the people who
        -   have a strong sense of love and belonging
        -   and the people who really struggle for it
    -   the people who have the strong senese of love and belonging is
        -   they believe they're worthy of love and belonging
        -   courage != bravery
        -   embrace vulnerable = what make them vulnerable make them beautiful
    -   numb emotions -> numb everything including happiness -> miserable -> numb emotion -> cycle
    -   we make the uncertain certain
    -   blame = a way to discharge pain and discomfort
    -   say we're sorry, we'll fix it
    -   'i'm enough' - kinder to ourself and to others
