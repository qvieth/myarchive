# The shape of data : distribution
- When collecting data to make observations about the world it usually just isn't possible to collect ALL THE DATA
- So instead of asking every single person about student loan debt
    - for instance we take a sample of the population
    - and then use the shape of our samples to make inferences about the true underlying distribution our data
- It turns out we can learn a lot about how something occurs, even if we don't know the underlying process that causes it
- Today, weâ€™ll also introduce the normal (or bell) curve
    - and talk about how we can learn some really useful things from a sample's shape 
        - like if an exam was particularly difficult
        - how often old faithful erupts
        - or if there are two types of runners that participate in marathons!
