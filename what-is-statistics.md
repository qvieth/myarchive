# what is statistics
- there're 2 related but seperate meanings of the word __statistics__ 
    - __field of statistics__ : the study and practice of collecting and analyzing data
    - __statistics__ : facts about, or summaries of data
- statistics are __tools__ for us to use
- but you're not measuring why people eat fast food everyday
- you're measuring what we call a "proxy", something that is related to what we want to measure, but isn't __exactly__ what we want to measure
- the tools we use to answer these questions are statistics plural, and there're 2 main types :
    1. descriptive
        - __descriptive statistics__ usually include things like __where the middle of the data is__ 
            - what statisticians call __measures of central tendency__ 
            - and measures of __how spread out the data are__
    2. inferential
        - inferential statistics allow us to make inferences
        - inferential statistics allow us to make conclusions that extend beyond the data we have in hand
        - we ask inferential statistics to do all sort of __much more complicated work for us__
        - inferential statistics lets us __test an idea or hypothesis__

- statistics help us filter the loads of data that come at us everyday
- __descriptive statistics__ make the data we get more digestible, even though we lose information about individual data points
- __inferential__ can help us make decisions when there's uncertainty
- but statistics can do all the work
    - they help us to reason, not to reason for us
    - they can get us through uncertainty, but they don't get rid of that uncertainty
