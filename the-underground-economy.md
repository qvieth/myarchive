Did you pay your quarterly taxes on declared income, with social security withholding's? ? Obtain an LLC? What was your Tax ID? Did you have employees? If so were they compensated per government guide-lines? Did you comply with OSHA and Health and Safety regulations? Did you follow non-discriminatory hiring practices? What about zoning? Did you get proper variances for running a business in a residential neighborhood?

If not, your in deep-shit buddy.
