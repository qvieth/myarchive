## Review
- The goal of this unit was to analyze text data more efficiently and effectively with natural language processing techniques
- Having completed this unit, you are now able to:
    - [ ] Understand what natural language processing is and how it can be used
    - [ ] Use NLTK and regular expressions to preprocess text data in preparation for various NLP tasks
    - [ ] Apply the Bag-of-Words language model to your corpus of text using scikit-learn
    - [ ] Analyze text for word importance using tf-idf
    - [ ] Create word embeddings to map words in relation to one another
