* new math :
    * visualization
    * reasoning
    * number sense
* [ ] logarithms, exponential, complex number
* **counting** is subgroup of math
* Computation is a subgroup of math
    * where you have to create ways to solve math in an efficient way
    * You can have algebraic computation, numeric computation statistical computation...
    * and a good computation involves math in every step of the algorithm 
    * even when you have verbose computation * since all is translated to machine code etc...
