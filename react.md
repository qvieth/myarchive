# react

- react hooks are functions that let us hook into the react state and lifecycle features from function components
- [react slots](https://daveceddia.com/pluggable-slots-in-react-components/)
- [props vs state :](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html#what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props)
     - While both are objects that **hold information** that influences the output of render
     - they are different in one important way:
     - props get passed to the component
          - (similar to function parameters)
     - whereas state is managed within the component
          - (similar to variables declared within a function)
- Though you need to work with state for interactive apps, you should avoid using many Stateful Components.
