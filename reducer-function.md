# reducer function

- `array.reduce`

- The [reducer function](reducer-function) takes four arguments:
     - Accumulator
     - Current Value
     - Current Index
     - Source Array
- Your reducer function's returned value
     - is assigned to the accumulator
     - **whose value is remembered across each iteration**
     - throughout the array
     - and ultimately becomes the final
     - single resulting value
