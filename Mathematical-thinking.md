# Mathematical thinking - crash course
- __Mathematical thinking__ is about seeing the world in a different way
- Which means sometimes seeing beyond our intuition or gut feeling
- a quick note about scientific notation :
    - scientific notation can be really helpful for calculating with big numbers,
    - but not necessary helpful for understanding them
    - without context, exponents can be non-intuitive if that's a word in their own way
- there're about 7.6 billion people on earth
- understanding the sheer number of people out there in the world can help us make sense of the commonness of coincidences or improbable events
- some statisticains call it the "law of truly large numbers"
- the idea here is that with a large enough group, or sample, unlikely things are completely likely to happen
- it's worth taking the time to think through small numbers , cause they can help you figure out what's actually worth worrying about
- __thinking mathematically__ isn't just about understanding numbers better
    - it's about asking important questions about the world around us
    - and letting numbers illuminate those question
