- when watching math videos :
    - **always reverse engineer from the graph(plot) to the formular
        - `DO NOT` look at the formular first then think toward the graph
## *1. the essence of calculus
- REFRAME THE PROBLEMS - sum of many small values
- 3 big ideas :
    - integrals
    - derivative
    - the fact that they are opposite
- SLIDE CIRCLE INTO MANY CONCENTRIC RINGS
- turn circle problem into triange problem => solve triangle
- how about problem turned into parabola ?
```
area under the function : integral of f(x) : A(x)
dA/dx \approx f(x) : derivative of A
dA,dx,dy
```
- and this back and forth between integrals and derivatives where
    - the derivative of a function for the are under the graph
    - gives you back the function defining the graph itself is
    - called FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS

## 2. the paradox of the derivative
* DERIVATIVE : INSTANTANEOUS RATE OF CHANGE? => OXYMORON
    - change : requires multiple points in time
    - instantaneous : one point in time
- graph the function s(t)
- $velocity = \frac{change-in-distance}{change-in-time}$
- $\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{rise}{run}$
- slope = rise/run
- y = mx + b | m : slope
* slope? tangent?
- for any specific choice of dt
* this ratio ds/dt is the **slope of a line passing through two points** on the graph
- as dt approaches 0, and those two points approach each other
    - the slope of that line approaches
    - the slope of a line tangent to the graph
    - at whatever point t we're looking at

## 3. derivative formulas through geometry
- THINK OF DERIVATIVE OF GEOMETRY -> model the geometry to findout what multiply with dx to disappeared
- POWER RULE
* 6:25 : IMPORTANT -> THINK OF VELOCITY THEN REVERSE ENGINEER TO DERIVATIVE
* when riding ,always think about the question :
    * what is your CURRENT velocity?
* f(\theta) = sin(\theta)


## 4. ***visualizing the chain rule and product rule
- sum, product, chain
- what to remember : how
    - sum : 2 graph combine for a higher graph
    - product : square
    - chained : 

## **5. what's so special about euler's number e?
- $e^{x}$
- comeback later

## ***6. implicit differentiation, what's going on here?
- zoom in close enough that
    - the curve basically looks just like its own tangent line
- x**2 + y**2 = 5**2 : -> circle
    - this is just implicit curve
    - just the set of all points(x,y) that satisfy some property
- implicit curve => implitcit differentiation
- related rates problems

## 7. limits, L'Hopital's rule, and epsilon delta definitions
```
Calculus required *continuity*, and continuity was supposed
to required the *infinitely little*; but nobody could discover
what the infinitely little might be - Bertrand Russell
```
- goal 1 : formal definition of a derivative
- goal 2 : (\epsilon, \delta) definition of limits
- goal 3 : L'Hopital's rule -> clever trick for computing limits

## **8. integration and the fundamental theorem of calculus
- how area under the curve (integral) is related to inverse of derivative
- this will build intuition for a whole class of 'integral problems' in math and science
- our SEQUENCE of approximations, whatever they are
    - gets better and better as dt gets smaller and smaller
- when think about dx or dt, think it as **infinitesimal**
- WATCH AGAIN

## 9. what does area have to do with slope?
- rewatch

## 10. high order derivative

## ***11. taylor series(infinitely sum) - taylor polynomials(finitely sum)
- degree of freedom
- 8:33 **factorial** come very natural in this process 
- taking information about the higher order derivatives of a function at a single point
- and translating it into information about the value of that function near that point

- the more term you choose, the closer the approximation
    - but the tradeoff is that your polynomial is more complicated
- in math, an infinitely sum is called a **series**
