- when watching math videos :
    - **always reverse engineer from the graph(plot) to the formular
        - `DO NOT` look at the formular first then think toward the graph
## *1. the essence of calculus
- 3 big ideas :
    - integrals
    - derivative
    - the fact that they are opposite
- respect the symmetry
- SLIDE CIRCLE INTO MANY CONCENTRIC RINGS
- many rectange-ish - thickness of each ring - dr
- area approximate 2.pi.r.dr
- the **graph of the function** 2pir
- *=> try measure are under the curve of square
- the reason why we care about this kind of problem is
    - because many practical problems that can be approximated by
    - add a large number of small things can be reframed
    - as a question about an area under a certain graph
- *=> this can solve a lot of hard problem in math and science
- the picture 8:38: velocity * difference in time = how far
```
area under the function : integral of f(x) : A(x)
dA/dx=f(x) : derivative of A
dA,dx,dy
```
- and this back and forth between integrals and derivatives where
    - the derivative of a function for the are under the graph
    - gives you back the function defining the graph itself is
    - called FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS

## 2. the paradox of the derivative
* DERIVATIVE : INSTANTANEOUS RATE OF CHANGE? => OXYMORON
    - change : requires multiple points in time
    - instantaneous : one point in time
- graph the function s(t)
- $velocity = \frac{change-in-distance}{change-in-time}$
- $\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{rise}{run}$
- slope = rise/run
- y = mx + b | m : slope
* slope? tangent?
- for any specific choice of dt
* this ratio ds/dt is the **slope of a line passing through two points** on the graph
- as dt approaches 0, and those two points approach each other
    - the slope of that line approaches
    - the slope of a line tangent to the graph
    - at whatever point t we're looking at

## 3. derivative formulas through geometry
- again : must learn about slope-rise/run-tangent
    - => extremely important for understanding df/dx
- when the function increase an amount of dx
    - leads to change in df
- POWER RULE
rewatch - sin - cosin


## 4. visualizing the chain rule and product rule
- sum, product, chain

## 5. what's so special about euler's number e?
- $e^{x}$
