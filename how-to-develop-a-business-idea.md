# how to develop a business idea
- entrepreneurs aren't a special group of people gifted with all the good ideas
    - they believe in themselves and the value of their idea enough to take a financial risk to make it a reality
    - they make life better by starting their business

- when we have exciting new ideas, our first instinct is to squirrel them away so no one can steal them. but that's bad. we have to share our ideas with the people who are actually going to use the product or service. otherwise, our solution inherit our blind spots and biases. they might not actually solve the problem or they might only be useful for a few people
- to get consult from people for our idea, target :
    1. customer who might have the problem we're trying to solve
    2. people who can help us think through our idea :
        - college campus with professor in entrepreneurship consulting
        - entrepreneurial networking groups like those in co-working spaces
        - around the world, you can check with your local government for similar organizations that provide education and financing for budding entrepreneurs
        * all these options are well-connected in the entrepreneurial community and it's their goal to mentor, consult, and connect fledgling entrepreneurs
        - don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help
- but before we get carried away, we have to remember : we're still making sure our idea is good and talking with potential customers. THIS IS NOT THE FINANCIAL STAGE
- we aren't asking people for seed money yet...

- the next step in work shopping an idea is to think big about the fundamental pieces of your business
- and a great way to do that is with a business plan tool like theBMC
- most lender care about your story, proof your idea works and is wanted, an understanding of your customers, and your financial plan, which often takes 5-10 pages tops, and BMC has section for all those thing
- filling out a business plan or BMC lets you collect all your thoughts about your idea and visualize how your business might exist
