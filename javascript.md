-   study architecture, concepts before coding
-   before study react :
    -   array methods like forEach() & map()
    -   fetch api & making http requests
    -   when using react, think of your UI as bunch of separate components
    *   component created by functions or classes -> return JSX
        -   component can also take in "props" in components = attributes
    -   components can have 'state' - **object** that determines how a component **renders and behaves**
    -   "app" or "global" state refers to state that is available to the entire UI, not just a single component
    -   when you have tons of state
        -   context apis
        -   3rd party state management : redux
    -   prior to react 16.8, we had to use class based components to use state
        -   now we can use functional components with hooks
        -   react hooks are functions that let us **hook** into
            -   the React state and lifecycle features
            -   from function components

-   [OOJS - inheritance - admin - user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cgBvtYT3fQ)
    -   chapter 9-10-11 : prototype property
    -   filter - array
    -   inheritence - extends - new class inherit from old class - superset subset
    -   methods chain - `return this`
-   named function
-   async = non-blocking i/o call
-   high order array methods
-   anonymous function
-   arrow function
-   ? : ternary operator
-   destructuring assignment to assign variables from arrays
-   rest operator
-   express :
    -   middleware functions are functions that have acces to the request and response object
    -   express has built in middleware but middleware also comes from 3rd party packages as well as custom middleware
    -   excute any code
    -   make changes to the request/response objects
    -   end response cycle
    -   call next middleware in the stack
