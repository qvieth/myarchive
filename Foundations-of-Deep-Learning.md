## Review
- The goal of this unit was to get an introduction to the fundamental concepts of deep learning
- You now understand concepts that power modern neural networks and can move forward onto learning how to develop your own DL models
- Having completed this unit, you are now able to:
    - [ ] Explain what deep learning is to a friend
    - [ ] Know different use cases for deep learning models
    - [ ] Trace the beginning-to-end path of data that journeys a neural network and understand the inner workings behind the journey
    - [ ] Decipher potential dangers for the use cases that involve deep learning models
- If you are interested in learning more about these topics, here is an additional resource:
