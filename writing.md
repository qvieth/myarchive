## FLEETING NOTES

- [creative writing vs essay](https://www.quora.com/Is-creative-writing-harder-than-writing-an-essay)
	- Most writing is, to some degree, creative
- [academic writing vs creative writing](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-academic-writing-and-creative-writing)
	- Creative writing generally means writing stories - novels. They are “creative” because they are making things up
	- Academic writing is designed to be accurate, concise and precise
	- I do believe academic writing can reinforce creative writing and vice-versa
- 
- Academic writing develops students' ability to express themselves by understanding topics and how to communicate on different subject fields.
- apposition : When you put two things right next to each other, you can call that apposition

```
Vigorous writing is concise
A sentence should contain no unnecessary words,
a paragraph no unnecessary sentences,
for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines
and a machine no unnecessary parts
This requires not that the writer make all sentences short,
or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline,
but that every word tell
```
