     1. use simpler words and phrases
     2. minimize the number of negative in a sentence
     3. write shorter sentence but avoid choppiness
     4. use important key terms consistently
     5. balance the use of simple and sophisticated language
- describe a person :
     - top to bottom

     - chronological

- [quora : why is it that, even though i read too much, i can't write?](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-that-even-though-I-read-too-much-I-can-t-write)
     - fear? -> 3 steps : **reading** -> **understanding** -> **remmembering** :
          1. improve your comprehension, understand the text you are reading deeply, don't read **passively**(not actively thinking about the elements of writing)
          2. make small notes -> help you recalling the facts while writing the final answer
          3. write the final answer (write with your memory, don't touch any reading material)
     - It’s possible that you’re reading as a passive reader, that is not actively thinking about the elements of writing
          - Try looking up meanings of words and phrases that you don’t understand
          - or noting certain things you like about the author’s writing style
          - like the comparisons
          - mental images
          - or word play
          - anything that you find impressive
     - There are two reasons such a thing can occur:
          1. you don't have anything hidden in your heart or there is nothing you are obsessed with. You don't have any dreams that you don't regret leaving half way. You don't have Any incomplete relationships. You read but you may or may not want to change or do something about it.
          2. it's not the right time yet.
     - You are telling like, you know all the traffic rules very well, but you are still not able to drive the car on the road
          - That is because you should actually drive to become good driver and you should read about traffic rules to become aware of traffic rules
          - Only when you do both, you will be very confident in driving
          - Similarly, you have to start writing to improve your writing. Reading can just give you better ideas to write better.
     - Try writing a fixed number of words, say 200 or so, everyday about a topic that interests you, and develop it into a habit

- Then you'll realize that writing is pretty less about language
- it's **more about our ability to think and model and generate content**
- But, there are three other things that need to be learned:
     - conceptualizing and structuring the basic bonework of your piece;
     - generating content;
     - and fleshing the bonework with content
- That's where learning to think gets mission critical. Try using the 5W trick - What, Why, Where, When, Who,
- **The trick is to start writing alongside reading**
- Start simple, like writing how to make coffee... describing a room... begin with the most apparent... and then move deeper.
- I even suggest trying this in your mother tongue.
- You'll be surprised to realize that most of us aren't really good in writing nicely even in our own mother tongue.
- Take it as a challenge. Then you'll realize that **writing is pretty less about language - it's more about our ability to think and model and generate content**
- try writing on quora
- simple sentence structure -> express ideas in straightforward ways
     - writing simply—focusing on ideas first and language only secondarily
     - So write a **draft** first, then revise & improve it.
          - And when you revise, don’t start with the language level: consider content and structure first.
          - This allows you to write better texts faster and possibly even enjoy yourself along the way
     - practice regularly

- The essay writing **process** consists of three main stages:
     - Preparation: Decide on your topic, do your research, and create an essay outline.
     - Writing: Set out your argument in the introduction, develop it with evidence in the main body, and wrap it up with a conclusion.
     - Revision: **Check** the content, organization, **grammar**, spelling, and formatting of your essay.
- structure
     - introduction
     - body
     - conclusion
- The writing process of preparation, writing, and revisions applies to every essay or paper,
     - but the time and effort spent on each stage depends on the type of essay.
- for a college-level argumentative essay, on the other hand, you’ll need to spend more time researching your topic
     - and developing an original argument before you start writing.

     - self-expression is a vital piece of the puzzle that is fulfillment in life;
     - work effectively with others
     - When we open up and express ourselves, we move from what she calls
          - a state of protection (coddling our ego and manning our inner walls to protect ourselves)
          - to a state of partnering (being open to sharing yourself with others and vice versa)
     - According to Glaser, this state is where we get our best and most innovative work done
     - As with most skills, the best way to improve your self-expression skills is to practice them!
