# supply and demand
- Main outtakes of this lesson
1. Market - any place where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods and services
    - An owner of a supermarket values the labor of the cashier more than money she pays him
2. Price signals - the information that markets generate to guide the distribution of the resources
    - Businesses, and in particular large corporations , are often villainized as greedy, heartless institutions, that take advantage of consumers
    - but if markets are transparent and buyers are free to choose, then businesses will have a hard time making advantage of people
3. Supply and demand
    - When the price goes up - people buy less, when the price goes down - people buy more
    - When the price goes up - the farmer wants to produce more, when the price goes down - the farmer wants to produce less
    - When quantity supplied = quantity demanded, we get equilibrium price of product
4. Four market behaviors
    - Supply can decrease
    - Supply can increase
    - Demand can increase
    - Demand can decrease
