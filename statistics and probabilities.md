# statistics and probability

-   [x] probability - distribution - the number 'one'
-   [x] heatmap for correlation

*   statistics is about making sense of data, and figuring out how to put that information to use

        -   as far as the hypothesis testing itself the actual method is basically exactly the same as what we've doing before :
            1. lockdown the rejection regions
            2. calculate the test statistics
            3. see where test statistic falls
            4. determine if reject or fail to reject

    - combination = permutation devided by `number of ways that you can arrange k people`
        - k! = number of ways that you can arrange k people
    - process for understanding permutation and combination :
        1. understand permutation
        2. understand k! :`number of ways that you can arrange k people`
        3. combine 2 picture of permutation and k! -> understand combination
