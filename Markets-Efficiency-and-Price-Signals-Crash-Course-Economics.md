# Markets Efficiency and Price Signals Crash Course Economics
- Main outtakes of the lesson
1. Central planning is not efficient
2. Two types of efficiency:
    - Productive Efficiency- The idea that products are made at lowest costs
    - Allocative Efficiency- State of economy in which production represents consumer's preference
3. Central planners are less likely to be allocatively efficient because they have a harder time getting feedback about what people want
4. Price Signals tells you what consumers are willing to by at higher prices
5. Price gouging: When sellers sells essential items (e.g water, food etc) at much higher price than reasonable
6. __Below-Cost Pricing__: This is also called Predatory Pricing. It's when a business drive out competitors by charging lower prices even at a short-term loss. Competitors that can't sustain such low prices will be forced out of the market giving the surviving businesses more market share and ability to raise prices
