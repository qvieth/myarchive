## FLEETING NOTES

- design :
     - **not** how something **looks**
     - but how something **works**
- We don’t need any more fancy buttons, or fancy transitions
- We don’t need a sexier new library
- What we need is to inform people better
     - and produce better and healthier guidelines
     - that address fundamental human perception paradigms
