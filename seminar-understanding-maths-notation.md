-   why people use maths notation?
    -   because it makes life easier
        -   easier to write maths down
        -   easier to be accurate
        -   easier to communicate with other language
        -   easier to think

*   how to understand maths notation?
    -   ask yourself :
        1. how do you say it? <- by knowing its name you can remember and google it
        2. what does it mean?
        3. what are the rules for working with it?
        4. how is it connected to other ideas

- where to find these answers?
    - listen to your teachers as they write 
    - look for definitions nearby in the notes/book
    - notice the rules in written examples
    - ask someone(google, latex cheatsheet)
- types of notation:
    - notation for **naming** things
    - notation for **making statements** about things
    - notation for **creating things** about things
    - notation for **abbreviating** words and phrases

## notation for naming
- notation for naming:
    - often need to name something you're talking about
    - for example "let x be the number we want to find"
        - greek letters
        - well-known objects
        - vector
        - subscripts
        - distributions
- naming : well known objects :
    - e : 2.71828...
    - \pi : 3,14...
    - \empty : empty set
    - N, Z, Q, R, C : set of... numbers
- naming : vectors
    - in print vector usually written in bold : **u**
    - in handwriting, they have an extra mark on head
- naming : subscripts :
    - give names to related things : c_1 c_2 c_3... (read c one or c sub one)
    - v = (v_1, v_2, v_3)
- naming : distributions :
    - the letters tell you which family of distribution and the numbers tell which one in that family
        - N(28,3) - normal distribution with mean 28 and standard deviation 3 
        - t_14 - t distribution with 14 degrees of freedom
        - X^{2}_{5} - chi squared distribution with 5 degrees of freedom
        - F(2,30) - F distribution with 2 numerator and 30 denominator degrees of freedom
        - B(10,0.7) - binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 0.7

* a distribution is a description of how likely everything is
* whole description of how likely all the possibilities are
* the letter part tells you which family it comes from and the numbers tell you more about which one within the family you have

## notation for making statements(expression)
- these notations go between bits of maths to make a statement
- read them aloud differently depending on context
- in programming expression is statements which return value
- in set language
    - \ : without 
    - | : such that

## notation for creating things
    - intervals : () [] : not include and include
    - \int_0^5 x^2 + 3x dx : "the integral from 0 to 5 of x squared plus 3x dx"
    - \sum_{i=1}^7(i^2 + 2) : "the sum of i squared plus 2 as i ranges from 1 to 7"
    - dy/dx |x=2 : dy on dx evaluated when x is equal to 3
    - lim_{x->\inf}1/x : the limit as x approaches infinity of 1 over x

## notation for abbreviating
- shortcuts for writing things because mathematicians are lazy or want to talk to people in other countries
    - x -> 3 - x approaches 3
    - f : R -> R - the function f sends the real numbers to the real numbers
    - => implies that
    - <=> if and only if
    - \exists : there exists
    - \exists ! : there exists a unique
    - \forall : forall
    - | such that
