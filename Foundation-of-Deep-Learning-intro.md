# Foundations of Deep Learning
- The goal of this unit is to grasp the foundational concepts of deep learning (DL)
- Through articles and interactive applets
    - you will gain an insight into the fundamentals of DL
    - and move forward with knowledge of some powerful and widely used machine learning algorithms

- After this unit, you will be able to:
   - Explain what deep learning is to a friend
   - Know different [use cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) for deep learning models
   - Trace the beginning-to-end path of data that journeys a neural network and understand the inner workings behind the journey
   - Decipher potential dangers for the use cases that involve deep learning models
