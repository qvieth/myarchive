# series and sigma notation
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYfgSLGV3mc
- THINK OF \SIGMA AS LOOP IN PROGRAMMING
    - upper limit
    - lower limit
    - index (aka dummy variable, dummy index) : the variable in the lower limit
    - summand 
    - some problem says : write down a sigma where summand is equal to whatever, have the upper limit, lower limit
- in the last few lessons, we have covered in great detail the concept of what the sequence is in math
- a sequence is just a listing of number
- we have different kinds of **sequences** :
    - arithmetic sequences
    - geometric sequences
- related to sequence : series
- series : sum of sequences
- \sigma notation
* integration is based on the concept of a series
* enstein's summation

- finite sequence (arithmetic sequence) :
    - 3, 7, 11, 15, 19
- finite series (arithmetic series) :
    - 3 + 7 + 11 + 15 + 19

- infinite sequence (geometric sequence) :
    - 1\2 , 1\4 , 1\8 , 1\16,...
```geometric series
because i'm multiplying by a common number
a **common multiplier** also called a **common ratio** of terms
we talked about that before
this infinite sequence is actually called a geometric sequence
sequences are important, series are actually even more important
```
