# book : style the basics of clariy and grace Joseph M William

## preface

- Whenever we reflect on what we do, we become self-conscious, sometimes to the point of paralysis.
- avoid those paralysis by remembering : these principles have little to do with how you **draft**, much to do with how you **revise**
- if there is a first principle of drafting, it is to forget all advice about how to do it.
- some writers plump up their prose, hoping that complicated sentences will indicate deep though.

## lesson 1 : understanding style

> Having something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That's the only secret of style.

Clarity And Understanding

- This book rests on two beliefs: it is good to write clearly, and anyone can do it.
- The difficult, even daunting, task of writing clearly has challenged generations of writer who have hidden their ideas not only from their readers but sometimes even from themselves.

The Lure Of Obscurity

- The keynote of the pretentious style is the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of using simple words, such as break, stop, spoil, mend, kill, a verb becomes phrase, made up of a noun or adjective tacked on to some **general-purpose verb** such as **prove, serve, form, play, render**.

Some Private Causes of Unclear Writing :
- Some writers plump up their prose, hoping that complicated sentences will indicate deep thought. And when we want to hide the fact that we don't know what we're talking about, we typically throw up a tangle of abstract words in long, complex sentences.
* As we struggle to master new ideas, we often write worse than we do when we write about things that we understand
- You will write more clearly when you more clearly understand what you are writing about.
- We are **likely to** confuse others when we write about a subject that confuse us. But when we become confused by a complex style, we too easily assume that its complexity signals deep thought.

This is a book about writing based on our ways of reading. When you understand why you judge one sentence to be dense and abstract and another clear and direct, you will know how to regconize not only when others' writing is more complex than deep but when yours may be as well

> a warning : if you think about these principles as you draft, you may never finish drafting. most experience writers get something down as fast as they can. then as they revise that first draft into something clearer, they understand their ideas better.

```
draft -> revise
see clearly - feel deeply - think carefully - write
```

- the more clearly we write, the more clearly we see and feel and think

## lesson 2 : actions

- 2 examples -> most of us would call 1a dense and complex, 1b clearer and more direct. but those words don't refer to anything in those sentences; they describe how those sentences make us **feel**
