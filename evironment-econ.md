- Environmental economics - how do we best deal with our natural resources?

# I. what can the government do?
1. enforce specific rules outside the market (just limit how much firms can pollute)
2. influence the market through price incentives 
    - add tax on products that cause pollution. (gasoline)
    - subsidize products that reduce pollution (electric cars, renewable energy)

- 1 and 2 example: permit market such as cap and trade which set limits on how much firms can pollute and allow them to buy and sell permits (money goes from heavy polluters to lighter polluters)

# II. how can technology help?
- since our current technology doesn't provide cheaper renewable energy, we can maximize the use of non renewable energy (energy-efficient cars)
- hindrances:
- rebound effect - efforts to increase energy efficiency creates more available energy that only gets spent into something MORE and MORE

# III. what actions are the world taking?
1. International treatys in which countries commit on reducing greenhouse gases emission. (UN negotiations)
2. funding "green" research into renewable energy
3. changes can be brought by individual consumers, along with changes by the government and producers. (turn the lights off when not in use! and other small things)

# Here are some other notes, hope they are helpful:
# Economic solutions:
1. Identify the sources of the most air pollution (factories that burn fossil fuels for energy
    - industries that use oil and coal to produce things; vehicles with internal combustion engines)
2. Decrease the supply of these technologies and products or decrease the demand for them
- There is a certain imbalance that comes with this
    - Some counties will harm the environment as there is no way to police every country
    - already established resources will be hard to demolish as people already got used to them and they are cheaper
    - That is until a new technology comes that is both effective and cheap
    - Or manipulating the markets with government subsidies, taxes, and regulations
- Pollution represents a __market failure__ – a situation where markets fail to produce the amount the society wants
- Government interventions are advised. Another way to encourage people to pollute less is by providing price incentives (taxes, subsidies)
    - Those incentives can encourage individuals to make choices that are better for the environment 
- Permit market – Setting a limit how much firms can pollute and allowing those firms to buy and sell pollution permits (Cap and Trade)
- Alternative energy sources usage is growing, but for the most part, they aren’t cheap enough yet, so the majority of our energy is likely to continue to come from non-renewable sources, at least for now

- Since there is no time, efficiency with the usage of fossils is advised, but still unsure
    - The rebound effect says the benefits of energy efficiency might be reduced as people change their behavior
    - Leading to more usage and more pollution

- There is still hope as there are constant ongoing discussions about this matter
    - Private companies and governments are also funding research into green technology
    - In the U.S. the American recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 allocated billions to fund renewable energy
    - China is also participating, being among the leading countries in renewable energy investments
- Companies, as well as consumers, need to be mindful to reach an effective solution.
