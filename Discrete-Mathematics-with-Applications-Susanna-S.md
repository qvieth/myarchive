# Discrete Mathematics with Applications Susanna S
## preface
- the goal of this book is to lay the mathematical foundation for
- computer science courses such as
    - data structures
    - algorithms
    - relational database theory
    - automata theory and formal languages
    - compiler design
    - and cryptography
- mathematics courses such as
    - linear and abstract algebra
    - combinatorics
    - probability
    - logic
    - and set theory
    - and number theory
- discrete mathematics describes processes that consist of a sequence of **individual** steps
- contrast with calculus : which describes processes that change in a **continuous** fashion
- The main themes of a first course in discrete mathematics are
    - logic and proof
    - induction and recursion
    - discrete structures
    - combinatorics and discrete probability
    - algorithms and their analysis
    - and applications and modeling

## Chapter 1 : speaking mathematically
1.1. variables
- using variables in mathematical discourse
- introduction to :
    - universal
    - existential
    - conditional statements

- an existential statement says that :
    - Given a property that may or may not be true
    - there is at least __one thing__?
        - for which the property is true
    - (For example: There is a prime number that is even)
-  A universal existential statement is a statement
- ex : every real number has an additive inverse
    1. universal - certain property is true
        - for all objects of a given type
    2. existential - a certain object exists
- An existential universal statement is a statement that is
- ex : There is a positive integer that is less than or equal to every positive integer
    1. existential - a certain object exists
    2. universal - certain property is true
        - for all objects of a given type

- Some of the most important mathematical concepts
- such as the definition of limit of a sequence
- can only be defined using phrases that are
    - universal
    - existential
    - and conditional
- and they require the use of all three phrases
    - “for every”
    - “there is”
    - and “if-then”
- if a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , is a sequence of real numbers, saying that
    - the limit of an as n approaches infinity is L
