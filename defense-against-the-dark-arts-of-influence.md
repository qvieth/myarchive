# defense against the dark arts of influence
- why do people choose to follow great leaders, or horrible ones?
- how do CEOs get better deals in the boardroom?
- => influence, it goes by a lot of names :
    - emotional inteligence
    - manipulation
    - social skills
- influence is an important tool that drives business decisions and social interactions
- => great power comes great responsibility
- influence has a dark side too, and can be used to pressure people into making some pretty bad decisions
- last time you've learn about rational reasons for trusting people
- but you also trust people because of emotional reasons, like your gut instinct when you first meet them
- sometimes, emotional cues can match up with cognitive trust
- influence relies heavily on charisma
- if someone's more likeable, they tend to be trusted more easily and can influence others
- 3 things psychologists say can make you more likeable :
    - confidence
    - praise
    - optimism
- => think about why you're trusting a __charismatic__ person, and whether or not you should
- confidence : number one way to build charisma and emotional influence
- => avoid uncertain language : 'maybe', 'in my opinion', 'i think', 'i could be wrong'
- *Fake it till you make it, yes for posture. Not for knowing things
