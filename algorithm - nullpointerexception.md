-   measureing efficiency of ASID with bigO - time complexity **equations**
    -   accessing - searching - iserting - deleting
    -   6 most common time complexity equations
        -   O(1)
        -   O(logn)
        -   O(n)
        -   O(nlogn)
        -   O(n^2)
        -   O(2^n)
        -   the more you use the more inefficient it becomes
-   we always use the worst case scenario when judgin these data structure
-   time and space complexity
    -   time complexity : how many steps
    -   space complexity : how many **extra memory**
        -   some algorithm require the computer to allocate extra memory in the computer
        -   selection sort is in-place algorithm : no auxilary memory
        -   worst case scenario will prevent system crash
        -   have to balance space and time/ make sacrifice which one to choose
-   sort : selection | insertion | odd-even | bubble | cocktail-shaker | quicksort | bitonic | heap | cycle
    -   merge sort : recurive sorting
    -   bucket sort : counting sort
    -   comb sort : exchange sort
    -   sorting algorithm
        -   -> speed
        -   -> memory required
