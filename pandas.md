## Review
- Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to gain an overview of data manipulation with pandas and introduce Python lambda functions
- Having completed this unit, you are now able to:
    - [ ] build and use Python lambdas functions
    - [ ] understand the basics of NumPy
    - [ ] create and manipulate pandas DataFrames
    - [ ] work with aggregates and multiple DataFrames using pandas
- If you are interested in learning more about these topics, here are some additional resources:
    - Book: Whirlwind Tour of Python, Jake VanderPlas
    - Documentation: [NumPy: the absolute basics for beginners](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html)
    - Documentation: [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html)
