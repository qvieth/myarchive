- [view](view) vs [context](context)
- [model](model)
     - [process](process)
- [design](design) vs [architecture](architecture)
- [question](question) vs [reasoning](reasoning) vs [cognitive](cognitive)
- [vertical - depth](vertical) vs [horizontal - breadth](horizontal)
- [abstract](abstract) !== concrete
     - [intermediate packets](intermediate packets)
     - [concept](concept)
     - [semantic](semantic)
     - [OOS](OOS)
     - [pattern](pattern)
- abstraction !== granularity

- framework for thinking :
     - gaussian elimination => design pattern => ...specific
     - specific => general => specific

---

- point system : to eliminate 2 polar(true,false|have,don't have) : 10
- to learn anything : PRACTICE
- IF YOU DEFINE THE PROBLEM CORRECTLY, YOU ALMOST HAVE THE SOLUTION
- sometimes, just reformulating the problem leads to better solution
- Day by day we discover algorithms for specifics **primitive problems** and this will go on until there will no more primitive problems to solve,
     - proven the fact that **complex problems** are solved by properly combining resolutions to more simpler problems.
- don't worry about remembering these code
     - **all i need to know is that these kinds of things are available**
     - and you can always head to the documentation if you want to find them out
- while learning nextjs :
     - often lost at **what problem i'm i solving**
     - at the simplest problem, when usecases changed
          - new, more sophiticated problem arise
- => this means even the most complicated, sophisticated problems
     - they **stem from the most simplest problems**
- ooo
- general = apply to multiple
- [approach](approach)
- to undertand a concept which is a part of a process
     - you have to understand the [process](process)
- [critical thinking](https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766)
- [Einstellung effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect)
     - the negative effect of previous experience
     - when solving new problems
     - though finding the solution is efficient
     - the solution itself is not or might not be
- inference : induction vs deduction vs abduction
- 2 approaches : bottom-up - top-down (page 13 - mathematics for machine learning)(should combine this)
- classification tree - how to navigate to the knowledge > knowledge
- conceptualize
- [question](question) theory/model -> May 20 , use category theory for visualize events, combine with question logic
- [plan](plan) -> [decision](decision) -> performance
- meaning of words - different based on **context**
- **USE IT OR LOSE IT** :D -> otherwise forget everything after understand it
- KEYWORD : FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF | BIG IDEAS OF | CHEATSHEET | CALCULATOR |
     - [I find that learning node.js is difficult for me. Can someone give me an advice?](https://www.quora.com/I-find-that-learning-node-js-is-difficult-for-me-Can-someone-give-me-an-advice)
          - do similar search
- Both **discovery** and **proof** are integral parts of **problem solving**
- math -> modeling problem
- think probabilistically : if we sample the data again, will the summary statistics the same?
- Recursive Thinking : The process of solving large problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler problems that have identical forms.
- true false -> true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative
- abduction - sherlock - 'when you have eliminated the immpossible, whatever remains however improbable must be the truth'
