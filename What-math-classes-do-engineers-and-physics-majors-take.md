# What math classes do engineers and physics majors take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1XJo0HqTS4
## part 1.
- guarantee :
    * calculus 1 2 3
    * linear algebra
    * differential equation


## part 2.
- fourier analysis/laplace transform : very important
    * fourier analysis :
        * any function can be represented as sum of sine(or cosine) function
        * ex :
            * signal of voice
            * signal processing
            * quantum mechanics
    * laplace transform : mathematical similar to fourier

- complex analysis
    * complex number
    * phase
    * euler's formula
- partial differential equations

## part 3.
- discrete math
- numerical methods
- statistics
