# aquinas and the cosmological arguments
- infinite regression
- aquinas's 5 arguments for the existence of god :
    1. arguments from motion
    2. arguments from causation
    3. arguments from contigency : necessary being and contigency being
    4. arguments from degrees
    5. teleological argument
- you can accept a conclusion but reject an argument
- if you __disagree__ with an argument, you don't get to say, yeah, you're wrong, you have to give a __counterargument__
- remember : philosophy is about dialectic
- this is what it means to do philosophy : to engage with arguments about stuff that matters
