# Exploratory Data Analysis?
- Exploratory Data Analysis involves two fundamental steps
    - Data Analysis (Data Pre processing, Cleaning and Manipulation).
    - Data Visualisation (Visualise relationships in data using different types of plots).

- This article gives an overview of exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Many people associate data science with fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence
- but EDA often takes up a larger percentage a data scientistâ€™s day-to-day work! This is because:
    - Before fitting any sort of machine learning __model__
        - it is important to inspect a dataset and get to know it!
        - Often the best way to improve a __model__ is to spend more time thinking about the data itself
        - EDA can help you make decisions about what data to include, exclude, or transform
    - Sometimes a data scientist does not plan to fit a predictive model to their data at all
        - Instead, their goal may be to inspect and analyze existing data to answer questions like:
            - What proportion of visitors to a website made a purchase?
            - Or, how has the purchase rate changed over the last 6 months?
> EDA generally happens before __model fitting__!

### Focus
- The EDA approach is precisely that--an approach--not a set of techniques
- but an attitude/philosophy about how a data analysis should be carried out 

### Techniques 
- Most EDA techniques are graphical in nature with a few quantitative techniques
- The reason for the heavy reliance on graphics is that by its very nature the main role of EDA is to open-mindedly explore
    - and graphics gives the analysts unparalleled power to do so
    - enticing the data to reveal its structural secrets
    - and being always ready to gain some new, often unsuspected, insight into the data
- In combination with the natural pattern-recognition capabilities that we all possess, graphics provides, of course, unparalleled power to carry this out

- The particular __graphical techniques__ employed in EDA are often quite simple, consisting of various techniques of:
    - Plotting the raw data such as :
        - data traces
        - histograms
        - bihistograms
        - probability plots
        - lag plots
        - block plots
        - and Youden plots
    - Plotting simple statistics such as :
        - mean plots
        - standard deviation plots
        - box plots
        - and main effects plots of the raw data
    - __Positioning__ such plots so as to maximize our natural pattern-recognition abilities
        - such as using multiple plots per page
