# vector
- vector v = [x,y] = xi + yj
    - i : basis vector of x coordinate (default : [1,0])
    - j : basis vector of y coordinate (default : [0,1])
    - think as 2 scalar times **default** i and j
- what if we choose another basis vector?
- tranformation = function
    - input vector -> output vector
    - can be think as **new** i-hat, new j-hat
