- cloud hosting :

```
 Instead of having your website residing on a single server
computer, you may opt to have it hosted in the “cloud.”
Cloud hosting refers to server clusters that share computing
across multiple computers. It’s a bit abstract, and more
difficult to visualize than your files sitting on a computer in
an office somewhere, so it’s better to focus on the benefits of
cloud hosting:
Cloud hosting plans are most appropriate for dynamic, data-
driven sites with a lot of performance demands, but there is no
reason why you couldn’t host a personal site in the cloud if the
price is right.
