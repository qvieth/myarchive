     - fear? -> 3 steps : **reading** -> **understanding** -> **remmembering** :
          1. improve your comprehension, understand the text you are reading deeply, don't read **passively**(not actively thinking about the elements of writing)
          2. make small notes -> help you recalling the facts while writing the final answer
          3. write the final answer (write with your memory, don't touch any reading material)
     - It’s possible that you’re reading as a passive reader, that is not actively thinking about the elements of writing
          - Try looking up meanings of words and phrases that you don’t understand
          - or noting certain things you like about the author’s writing style
          - like the comparisons
          - mental images
          - or word play
          - anything that you find impressive
     - You are telling like, you know all the traffic rules very well, but you are still not able to drive the car on the road
          - That is because you should actually drive to become good driver and you should read about traffic rules to become aware of traffic rules
          - Only when you do both, you will be very confident in driving
          - Similarly, you have to start writing to improve your writing. Reading can just give you better ideas to write better.
     - Try writing a fixed number of words, say 200 or so, everyday about a topic that interests you, and develop it into a habit

- But, there are three other things that need to be learned:
     - conceptualizing and structuring the basic bonework of your piece;
     - generating content;
     - and fleshing the bonework with content
- That's where learning to think gets mission critical. Try using the 5W trick - What, Why, Where, When, Who,
- **The trick is to start writing alongside reading**
- Start simple, like writing how to make coffee... describing a room... begin with the most apparent... and then move deeper.
- I even suggest trying this in your mother tongue.
- You'll be surprised to realize that most of us aren't really good in writing nicely even in our own mother tongue.
- Take it as a challenge. Then you'll realize that **writing is pretty less about language - it's more about our ability to think and model and generate content**
- try writing on quora
- simple sentence structure -> express ideas in straightforward ways
     - writing simply—focusing on ideas first and language only secondarily
     - So write a **draft** first, then revise & improve it.
          - And when you revise, don’t start with the language level: consider content and structure first.
          - This allows you to write better texts faster and possibly even enjoy yourself along the way
     - practice regularly
