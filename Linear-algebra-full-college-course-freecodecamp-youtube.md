# Linear algebra full college course freecodecamp youtube
- Dr. Hefferon's Linear Algebra text book
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnTa9XtvmfI
- the idea of this presentation is that for each topic
    - you can first watch the video
    - then study the book
    - and finally **do the homeworks**
- however, whatever resources you use :
    - you can't just watch videos
    - you must do the homework
    - IF YOU **HAVE NOT DONE A LOT OF HOMEWORK** THEN YOU **HAVE NOT LEARN LINEAR ALGEBRA**

## chapter 1 : solving linear systems
- linear combination
- linear equation is just linear combination make into equation
```Gauss's method :
if a linear system is changed to another by one of these operations
    1. an equation is swapped with another
    2. an equation has both sides multipled by a nonzero constant
    3. an equation is replaced by the sum of itself and a multiple of another then the two systems have the same set of solutions
- the proof is in the book
```
### big ideas : gauss's method
- definition : the three operations from theorem 1.5 are
    - the elementary reduction operations
    - **or** row operations
    - **or** gaussian operations
- they are
    - swapping
    - multiplying by a scalar (or rescaling)
    - and row combination
## describing the solution set
