# [value proposition and customer segments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2IPvT920XM&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNamNKW5qlS-nKgA0on7Qze&index=4)
- value is the core of any business, and it directs all future decisions, innovations, and customers that get targeted
- even if we've thought about the big picture, if we can't explain how an idea makes someone's life better, then why should anyone pay attention?
- when we write a value proposition, we have to think about two main things :
    1. the experiences of our customers
    2. the capabilities of our product or service
- there are lots of ways to connect with potential customers, but industry favorites include :
    - interviewing them one-on-one
    - holding __focus groups__
    - conducting surveys : either in person or through an online service like SurveyMonkey
- ask question what why where how - all these questions paint a picture of who we're dealing with, and give us a peek at their jobs
- and when we're dealing with value propositions, customer jobs can be
    - functional : what we'd tradionally regconize as work that pay the bills
    - social : customer feel social obligations to look good or support their community
    - or emotional : all the work we put in to grow as humans
- the ultimate goal of understanding customer jobs is to get into their heads :
    - __what they do illuminates what they value or what they'd like to value__
- remember the point of the value proposition :
    - why should people choose you over everyone else?
- disruption : strategy to give customers value, and it's a hot business vocab word
- instead of challenging existing markets and trying to make our idea stand out in a field of others
- why not create a new market, often called as blue ocean
- here, we're not talking about value that comes from lower prices or faster delivery
- we're talking about letting customers achieve the same jobs in a totally new format
- by understanding customer jobs, pains, and gains, we can make sure our products and services alleviate pains or create gains
- => value proposition : a statement basically saying why we're better than everybody else
