# crash course geography
## review
- connections of :
    - maps
    - rivers
    - mountains
    - cities
    - cultures
    - people
- it's an inquisitive, close-up look at how we shape the land and how in turn the land shapes us
- like where and how we choose to produce our food, move our goods, and build our economies
- and what happens when natural or human-caused forces change or disrupt entire ecosystems

- geography is studied as two interconnected parts :
1. physical geography :
    - why is the seafloor so young when the earth is so old?
    - or try to indentify why winds and ocean currents are so important to life on earth
    - or explain why the aral sea in central asia has been called 'one of the worst environmental disasters in modern history'
2. human geography :
    - explore the ways people occupy the Earth's surface
    - like how we've moved, settled, and used the land, resources and space
    - how languages migrate and change
    - how humans interact with their environment
        - e.g. how for centuries people have relied on the seasonal monsoon rains in India to bring life-giving moisture to their crops 

- there's not a clear line dividing the physical and the human
    - which is where geography gets its strength
    * BECAUSE, REALLY, GEOGRAPHY IS TELLING THE STORY OF THE EARTH
    * even something as commonplace as banana has a complicated backstory that twists across continents and climates and turns betweens vast trade networks and political coups

## 1. what is geography 
- in geography, **human-environment interactions**
    - are all the ways humans **connect** with
    - and **live** within the environment
    - and the impact the environment has on
    - lives, choices, and experiences of people
- => THIS IS **KEY** TO GEOGRAPHERS
- but there are always more questions
- like if we focus on the environment part of human-environment interactions
- what's the environmental impact of these large plantations
- geography is that factoid AND the story that surrounds it
- we just looked at the geography of bananas,
- but we could have dont the same thing for chocolate, or the Nile River valley
> the Earth has so many stories, and geography is here to tell them

- clearly, the world is complicated, but in geography we try to look at the big picture
- the confluence of space, place and human-environment interactions
- and how they've overlapped to bring us this far into the story
- it's all about how things vary from place to place and asking 'why here?'
- let's all try to think about the interconnectedness of
- Earth and its people and economies and histories
- and the fact that a banana factoid can be way more complicated than we expect
- that's what will make us all a little more thoughtful and geographically aware

## **2. What is a Map?
- insightful => visualize data on map for statistics
* DIFFERENT KINDS OF MAPS
    * rewatch for seeing different kinds of maps
    * these charts were someone's own perception of the space
        * in their individual world

- cartographers : map makers
- they need to pick which data they want to focus on
    - and the type of map they pick
    - often depends on what story they want to tell

## 3. What is space and how do we study it?
- to describe those spatial relationships, we need to recognize topological space
    - which measures and analyzes how the features in space
    - are arranged and connect to each other
- **spatial analysis** is a blend of geography and math
- that indentifies and analyzes those patterns and relationships
- in space using a range of technniques including :
    - image technology
    - statistics
    - and geometry

- remote sensing, or studying something without physically contacting it, is an entire subfield of geography that lets us do just that

- studying space:
    - as a container
    - topologically
    - socially
    - how we individual perceive it

- insightful story about earthquake :
    - input aerial and satellite images into a mapping platform
    - called **OpenStreetMap**
    - with OpenStreetMap, volunteers can look at space as a container
    - and use those images to trace buildings, parks, roads and more
    - to create a basic digital map
    - that map can then be used by anyone in the world
        - with access to OpenStreetMap
- basically, anyone can be a geographer and create the maps their community needs
- you can get involved at `openstreetmap.org` or `tasks.hotosm.org`

## 4. What is physical geography?
- physical geography is all about regconizing the characteristics
    - of the environment and the processes that
    - create, modify and destroy those environments 
* IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
- we think of there being 4 major Earth systems :
    1. atmosphere : the layer of air surrounding Earth : clouds, weather, ozone layer, air we breathe
    2. hydrosphere : water in the atmosphere, water in plants & animals, oceans, lakes & ice caps, water underground
    3. lithosphere : outermost layer of earth
    4. biosphere : where life can exist
- no matter what we choose to focus on in physical geography
- all 4 spheres will play a role
- the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere and biosphere
- are driven and influenced by the sun and insolation, or incoming solar radiation
- geomorphologists
- pedogogy
- hydrology
- all these different 'spheres' of Earth could be their own field - and some of them are
- what differentiates physical geography from other scientific fields is the focus on spatial patterns in the landscapes
- physical geographers investigate not only variation from place to place in the various sphere
- but also the complex interaction within and between different spheres and how they change over time and across scales

## 5. How does the Earth move?
- insolation : incoming solar radiation
