# precalculus james stewart

-   each chapter has a review part - this is like a cheatsheet
-   \*\*finding a function that describes the dependence of one quantity on another is called modeling

## prologue : principle of problems solving

-   priciple of problem solving :
    1. understand the problem
    2. introduce notation (modeling)
    3. state what is given
    4. identify the unknown
    5. connect the unknown with the given

## 1. fundamentals

real number

-   the different types of real numbers were invented to meet specific needs
-   properties : commutative, associative, distributive
-   laws of exponents : a^{-1} = frac{1}{a}
