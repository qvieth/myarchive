# controlled experiments
- We may be living IN a simulation (according to Elon Musk and many others)
    - but that doesn't mean we don't need to perform simulations ourselves
- Today, we're going to talk about good experimental design and how we can create controlled experiments to minimize bias when collecting data
- We'll also talk about single and double blind studies
    - randomized block design, and how placebos work
