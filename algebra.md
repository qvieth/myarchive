    - https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/fundamental-theorem-algebra.html
- log_{6}216 : log base six of two hundred and sixteen
- slope : rise/run
    - how to define : pick 2 points on a line A and B
        - how much does A go up to B
        - how much does A goes side to side to B

* exponential : i didn't understand this completely
    * what really is exponential of fraction?
    * steep vs flat

## Linear algebra
- **CONCEPTS OF SOLVING SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS**
    - => one of the most important reasons
        - that anybody learns about linear algebra / matrices
    - which means you have 3 equations and 3 unknowns
    - or 6 equations and 6 unknowns
- you learn in basic algebra how to solve those systems :
    - you might use substitution
    - you might try to graph them and see where they intersect
    - or whatever, which is fine for small systems
    - but **for large systems** with four or five variables
    - it's very difficult to
    - apply substitution of graphing methods
    - to get to the answer
    - so matrix methods can be applied to any systems of equations
    - any linear system of equations
    - where we have multiple unknowns and multiple equations

- three ways of thinking about these systems :
    - The "row method" focuses on the individual equations
    - the "column method" focuses on combining the columns
    * and the "**matrix method**"
        - is an even more compact and powerful way
        - of describing systems of linear equations
