## Review
- Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to learn about various hypothesis tests.
- Having completed this unit, you are now able to:
    - [ ] Understand the theory behind hypothesis testing
    - [ ] Form a null and alternative hypothesis for a hypothesis test
    - [ ] Interpret a p-value
    - [ ] Implement many different hypothesis tests in Python, including 1- and 2-sample t-tests, ANOVA, Tukeyâ€™s range test, a Binomial test, and a Chi-Square test
    - [ ] Determine an appropriate sample size for a hypothesis test
- If you are interested in learning more about these topics, here are some additional resources:
