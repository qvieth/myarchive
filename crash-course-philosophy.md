# 1. what is philosophy
- philosophy : reasoning - argument - logic - rationality - truth
# 2. how to argue philosophical reasoning
- rewatch
# 3. how to argue induction and abduction
- induction : using past experience to make future prediction - probability
- abduction : drawing a conclusion based on the explanation that best explains a state of events, rater than from evidence provided by the premises : aka inference


# 8. karl popper science and pseudosience 
- but if you're a scientist, you'll have to let your beliefs go
- accept evidence & move on

- this is the modern scientific thinking that we accept today :
    - testable
    - refutable
    - falsifiable
- you don't seek to prove scientific hypothesis right, you only prove them wrong
- knowledge is about probability and contigency
- we are justified in believing whatever seems most probable given out current data
- and we should always be willing to revise our beliefs in the light of new evidence
- in other words, our belief should be contigent on the data themselves
- certainty should never be possible in the first place
- if anything he thought being certain of something causes you to close your mind, and that's not what we want
- always remaining open to the idea that your current beliefs might be wrong is the best way to get ever closer to the truth
- remember, we started out trying to prove that we know the things we thought we know
- but you have to be open to the idea that your beliefs might be false - because that's the only way that holding onto them can really mean anything
- science disconfirms while pseudoscience confirm
# 10. aquinas and the cosmological arguments
- infinite regression
- aquinas's 5 arguments for the existence of god :
    1. arguments from motion
    2. arguments from causation
    3. arguments from contigency : necessary being and contigency being
    4. arguments from degrees
    5. teleological argument
- you can accept a conclusion but reject an argument
- if you __disagree__ with an argument, you don't get to say, yeah, you're wrong, you have to give a __counterargument__
- remember : philosophy is about dialectic
- this is what it means to do philosophy : to engage with arguments about stuff that matters
# 11. intelligent design
- over the centuries, the effort to craft a perfect, bullet-proof argument for the existence of god has taken many forms
    - there was the ontological argument of anselm
    - there were the four cosmological arguments of aquinas
- intelligent design : argument by analogy
- teleology : purposeful
- how bodies came to today : natural selection and random mutation

# 24. determinism vs free will
*great insight about what marketing is trying to do
- decisions : inevitable __results__ of a bunch of mental stuff __combining__ in just the rightway => great insight
