# karl popper science and pseudosience 
- but if you're a scientist, you'll have to let your beliefs go
- accept evidence & move on

- this is the modern scientific thinking that we accept today :
    - testable
    - refutable
    - falsifiable
- you don't seek to prove scientific hypothesis right, you only prove them wrong
- knowledge is about probability and contigency
- we are justified in believing whatever seems most probable given out current data
- and we should always be willing to revise our beliefs in the light of new evidence
- in other words, our belief should be contigent on the data themselves
- certainty should never be possible in the first place
- if anything he thought being certain of something causes you to close your mind, and that's not what we want
- always remaining open to the idea that your current beliefs might be wrong is the best way to get ever closer to the truth
- remember, we started out trying to prove that we know the things we thought we know
- but you have to be open to the idea that your beliefs might be false - because that's the only way that holding onto them can really mean anything
- science disconfirms while pseudoscience confirm
