- the process by which an agent creates
     - a **specification** of a software [artifact](artifact)
     - intended to accomplish goals
     - using a set of primitive components
     - and subject to [constraints](constraint)
- Software design may refer to either
     - "all the activity involved in
          - conceptualizing
          - framing
          - implementing
          - commissioning
          - and ultimately modifying complex systems"
     - or "the activity following requirements specification
     - and before programming in a stylized software engineering process."
- It involves problem-solving and planning a software solution
     - This includes both
          - a low-level component and [algorithm](algorithm) design
          - and a high-level, [architecture](architecture) design
