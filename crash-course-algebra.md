## 1. solving problems
- what does it mean to solve an equation => like balacing the scale
- variables
- balancing equation
- solution set = {55,77}

## 2. word problems
## 3. negative numbers and arithmatics
- communitive property
- **rectangle chopping => distributive property
- algebra magic trick
## 4. understanding fractions
## 5. irrational numbers
- proof by contradiction

## 6. exponents and scientific notation
```
scientific notation is a way of rewriting very large and very
small numbers with power of 10 to make their size comprehensible
```

## **7. logarithms and exponents
- exponents | log | e
- modeling **growth** or **decay** => `use e`
- describing something in orders of magnitude => probably `log-base-10`

## **8. polynomials and imaginary numbers
```
a polynomial is a _algebraic quantity_ where the _variables_
involved have only _whole_, _non-negative exponents_
like in _x^2 and x^5_ and they can actually approximate a lot of
the messy models we might create to get us some answer
```
- algebraic expressions are generic quantities that combines numbers and variables
    - => 5x + 3
    - also is a polynomial expression because it is just quantity, and it's polynomial
    - because the variables have only whole, non-negative exponents
- rational expression?
- i^2 = -1
- with imaginary numbers, mathematicians were able to prove
    - the `FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA`
    - which guarantees that every polynomial can be solved with
        - an integer
        - a fraction
        - [irrational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number)
        - imaginary number
* => knowing that all equations have solutions means
    * we can go ahead and create algorithms
    * or write programs for finding solutions to equations
    * without fear of the program crashing

## *9. quadratic equations
- a special group of polynomials with x^2 as the largest power of x that appers
- ax^2 + bx+ c = 0 => parabola - U-shaped
```
without an x^2, we'd be back to a linear equation
like we solve way back in episode 1
```
- now last episode we talked about how polynomials in general can be used to turn complicated mathematical models
- into something we can work with more easily
- and, as we just saw on our whirlwind tour of history
- quadratic equations keep showing up in interesting real-life problems
- including problems with more than one solution

- quadratic equations are especially great becuase they're simple enough that we can work with them by hand
- yet complicated enough to help us practice the thinking we need to work with more difficult polynomial equations later
```
a quadratic equation is one that can be solved by drawing a square
- hence the name, which comes from the Latin word quadratum or
quaratus, which means square
```
- all the tools you need without memorizing anything :
    - your built-in :
        - human inventiveness
        - logic
        - eye for symmetry
```
if you're stuck, the first, the best, the greastest tip
for working with a quadratic equation is to draw a square
and complete it
```
## 10. what does 'graphing an equation' mean?
- in college algebra, a `graph` is a way to `visual data`
    - with points on `two perpendicular number lines`
    - that make what we call the `Cartesian plane`
- fitting an equation to data is actually called `curve fitting`
- `extrapolation` : estimate value outside the data range
- `interpolation` : estimate value between the data range

* equation describing relationships between variables where
    * every input has only one possible output - called __functions__
    - and they're often what we're really graphing
    - when we're graphing equation

- piecewise function :
    - one function made up of different equations
    - for different groups of inputs, and can be tricky to plot
- piecewise functions turn up in a surprising number of places
- for college algebra
    - they're a good way to practice graphing
    - and interpreting equations
- but you've constructed a piecewise function
    - with speed and time
    - whenever you've taken the train to work
    - and then walked the rest of the way
    - and 3-d computer graphics rely on peicewise polynomials
    - to describe curved shapes
    - ... watch video at 7:35 for easy understanding piecewise graph

## **11. graphing the quadratic
- standard form : ax^2 + bx + c
- vertex form : a(x-h)^2 + k
- the heights of objects in motion follow this quadratic formula :
    - galileo's projectile motion :
    - h = -16t^2 + vt + d
        - v : how fast we throw the object up
        - d : how high we start above the ground

* important cheat sheet : 9:30
- remember that all graphs of quadratic equations
    - are essentially graphs of y=x^2
- the vertex form of a quadratic equation lets you read
    - the vertex(h,k) right away
    - y = a(x - h)^2 + k
- use the symmetry of the parabola
    - rewrite it as y=x(ax+b) + c and find
    - the two x values that give the same y-value c

## ***12. linear and simultaneous equations and graphs
```
a line is straight if the ratio of rise over run -
which we call *slope* - is the same number, no matter
where you choose to measure that ratio along the line
```
=> rise / run = slope
- 6:34 parallel vs perpendicular
- finding intersection value between lines is solving simultaneous equations
```
q : how many gallons of 50% salt solution and how many
gallons of 10% salt solution would have to be comabined
to make 4 gallons of 20% salt solution?
```

## 13. all kinds of graphs
- today we'll tweak the techniques we've learned in our last two episodes on graphing
    - like **employing symmetry** and **plugging in points** to plot data
    - to graph just about everything else we might encounter in college algebra
* remmeber how graphs of quadratic equations were all just fancier version of y = x^2
    - once we find the core structure of these new equations
    - we'll see that we can plot just about anything

## 14. fitting equation to data
- scatterplot - correlation - fitting an equation
- in science and the rest of life, there are
    - a surprising number of **linear correlations**
    - which are relationship between two variables
    - that look like a straight line when plotted
- line of best fit : always passes through the **heart of the data**
- using data to estimate that line is called **linear regression**
    - **linear** because we're finding a straight line
    - **regression** because we're looking back at the data we have
        - and fitting an equation to it retroactively
- for logarithmic, exponential, or polynomial relationships in your data, you just need to **reframe the relationship** between x and y
