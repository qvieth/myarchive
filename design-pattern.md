- a software design pattern is a general reusable **solution**
     - to a **commonly occurring** problem
     - within a given context in software design
- It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly
     - into source or machine code
- Rather, it is a description or template for
     - how to solve a problem that can be used
     - in many different situations
- Design patterns are formalized best practices
     - that the programmer can use to solve common problems
     - when designing an application or system
- Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach
     - to computer programming intermediate between
     - the levels of a programming [paradigm](paradigm)
     - and a concrete [algorithm](algorithm)
- [GOF book about design patter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
	- read the critism part
	- patterns are simply workarounds for missing features 
	- replacing elegant abstract features with lengthy concrete patterns
	- essentially becoming a "human compiler" or "generating by hand the expansions of some macro".
