- [wiki : ADLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_description_language)
- used in several disciplines:
     - system engineering
     - software engineering
     - and enterprise modelling and engineering
- The software engineering community
     - uses an architecture description language
     - as a computer language to create a description
     - of a software architecture
- In the case of a so-called [technical architecture](technical-architecture)
     - the **architecture**
          - must be communicated to software developers
     - a functional architecture
          - is communicated to various stakeholders and users
- Some ADLs that have been developed are:
     - Acme (developed by CMU)
     - AADL (standardized by the SAE)
     - C2 (developed by UCI)
     - SBC-ADL (developed by National Sun Yat-Sen University)
     - Darwin (developed by Imperial College London)
     - and Wright (developed by CMU)
