## in software architecture
- there are many __layers__ between the hardware and end user
- the __front__ can be considered a device or service
- while the __back__ usually handles __data storage__ and __business logic__

## in tele communication
- the __front__ can be considered a device
- while the back is infrastructure that supports provision of service

## rule of thumb
- a rule of thumb is that the client-side (or 'front end') is any component manipulated by the user `<br>`
- the server-side (or 'back end') code usually resides on the server, often far removed physically from the user

## web development as an example
knowlege required of a front-end vs back-end web developer:
### both
- version control : git , mercurial, subversion
- __file transfer tools__ and protocols such as FTP or rsync

### front-end
- __markup and web languages__ such as _HTML, CSS, Javascript_, __ancillary libraries__ commonly used in those languages such as _Sass_ or _jQuerry_
- __asynchronous__ request handling and __AJAX__
- single-page applications (with framworks like react, angularjs or vuejs)
- web performance
- responsive web design
- cross-browser compatibility issues and workarounds
- end-to-end testing with a headless browser
- build automation to transform and bundle Js files, reduce image size... with tools like _Webpack or Gulp.js_
- search engine optimization
- accessibility concerns
- basic usage of image editing tools such as GIMP or Photoshop
- UI

### back-end focused
- __scripting languages__ like PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js or Compiled languages like C#, Java or Go
- Automated testing frameworks for the language being used
- application data access
- application business logic
- database administration
- scalability
- high availability
- security concerns, authentication and authorization
- software architecture
- data transformation
- backup methods and software

__NOTE that both positions, despite possibly working on one product, have a very distinct set of skills__
