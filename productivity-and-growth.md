# productivity and growth
- Summary for you guys:
1. Why some countries have high GDP and others have low( some countries are rich and other poor):
    - Lack of natural resources 
    - Corrupt governments
2. GDP per capita(output per person) is used to tell how wealthy a country is 
3. Countries with high GDP/capita have far less infant mortality, poverty and preventable diseases
4. Productivity and growth:
    - The more a worker produces, the more a worker can earn
    - Economists argue that the main reason that some countries are rich is because of productiivty 
    - Higher value produce also the growth effect
    - Productivity is key, but there are limits
5. People in poor countries need food, water, plumbing, hospitals and medicine, and all of those things are needed to get better efficiency  
6. How much stuff is produced per person(can be called GDP)
7. Factors of production effect the efficiency: 
    - Land
    - Workers
    - Capital( and also workers education, knowledge aka human capital)
    - Technology: The sum total of knowledge and information that society has acquired concerning the use of resources to produce goods and services
        - (Connectivity= productivity)
- Increasing Productivity has resulted in increasing standards of living(globally and historically)
- Factors of production : main ingredients we need to produce things
    1. first you need land, which includes all natural resources
    2. and then you need workers which is labor
    3. and then you need capital which includes machines and factories and infrastructure, things you need to produce other things
        - one special type of capital is the worker's education knowledge and skills required to produce things
        - economists call this human capital
        - so school not just torturing you, except for PE, it's about helping your human capital
        - the quantity and quality of these resources is the first step to being more productive
        - but perhaps even more important is how you use them
        - increasing the amount of capital has a cost, but finding news ways to organize production is virtually free
        - economists call the organization effectiveness '__technology__'
        - think of it as the good ideas about how to combine labor and capital that you already have
