# [inflation and bubbles and tulips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8-85cZRI9o&list=PL1oDmcs0xTD-dJN1PL2N1urX0EKupBJCQ&index=8)
- In which Adriene and Jacob teach you about how and why prices rise
- Sometimes prices rise as a result of inflation, which is a pretty normal thing for economies to do
- We'll talk about how across the board prices rise over time, and how economists track inflation
- Bubbles are a pretty normal thing for humans to do
- One item, like tulips or beanie babies or houses or tech startups experience a rapid rise in prices
- This is often accompanied by speculation, a bunch of outrageous profits, and then a nasty crash when the bubble bursts
- People get excited about rising prices, and next thing you know, people are trading their life savings for a tulip bulb

- Main outtakes of this lesson
1. __Purchasing power__ - the amount of physical goods and services that can be bought by a given amount of money
    - __Consumer price index (CPI)__ - a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically
    - "__Real__" past price - inflation adjusted 
        - __Nominal__ past price - no inflation adjusted
    - Since we have to keep the market basket constant over time, a traditional CPI won't adjust for either new products or increases in product quality
2. Inflation - an increase in a currency supply relative to the number of people using it, resulting in rising prices of goods and services over time
    - Demand pull inflation - too much money chasing too few goods
3. Bubbles - a market phenomenon characterized by surges in asset prices to levels significantly above the fundamental value of that asset
    - Speculation - trading a financial instrument involving high risk, in expectation of significant returns
