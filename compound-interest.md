- there's an exponential function that determines how much money you're gonna earn an interest or how much debt you're gonna pay in terms of interest on the loan
```einstein
compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world
he who understands it earn it
he who doesn't pays it
```
- compound interest governs how much money you're gonna earn when you put money in the bank
- or when you invest money in the retirement account or just in the stock market to try to acquire wealth
- so that compound interest is the exponential function
- you know the shape of that exponential function goes up very rapidly
- so if you save money it's the 8th wonder of the world because it gives you more and more money over time
- he who doesn't pays it mean: when you buy a house you have a loan and that loan acquires it you have to pay interest on that loan
    - and the amount of money you owe goes up and up also exponentially with time
- compound annually : n=1
- compound quarterly : n=4
- compound interest formula :
```
A = P(1+r/n)^{nt}
ex. you invest $1000 at an annual rate of 12%, compounded quarterly, how long to triple in value?
P : principal | 1000
r : annual interest rate | 0.12
n : compounded 'n' times per year | n=4
t : time in years | t = ?
```
- sometimes you have to use LOGARITHMs to get to the final answer
