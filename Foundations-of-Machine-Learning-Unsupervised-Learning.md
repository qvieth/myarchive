## Review
- Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to learn how to build machine learning models that can recognize patterns using unlabeled data
- Having completed this unit, you are now able to:
    - [ ] Apply k-means and k-means++ clustering to build an unsupervised classifier
    - [ ] Understand hierarchical clustering
    - [ ] Leverage Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of your dataset
    - [ ] Use clustering to identify patterns in data from a masculinity survey
