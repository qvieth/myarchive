- solve triangles
- radiants or degrees
    - sin(x) cos(x) tan(x)
    - always think of x deg or rad?
- 2 in 3 of triangle
## radians - angle measured in terms of radius
C = 2 * \pi * r

## coterminal angles
- add or subtract 2\pi

## convert radians to degrees
```
r/pi = d/180
```

## radians - angle measured in terms of radius

## ** 5.2 right triangle trig
- how are the ratios of the sides of triangles related
1. ratio of sides :
    - rise/run = slope
    - on the cartesian plane :
        - y value : rise
        - x value : run
        - rise/run = tan = slope

2. if angle remains constant, so does the ratio of the sides :
    - SOHCAHTOA
    - tan : tangent = slope
    - tangent inverse : tan^-1

## law of sines
sina/a = sinb/b = sinc/c

## more identities

## (8:15:18) Sequences
- Q : what is a sequence? 
- A : sequence - ordered list of numbers
    1. recursive - define the first term ($a_{1}$) and how each term relates to previous term
    2. explicit - define each term with a formula based on position
- B. factorial
- C. find explicit formulas
## (8:35:23) Series
- Q : what are series?
- A : series - sum of numbers in a sequence
## (8:52:00) Arithmetic Series
- Q : how do we find the sum of an arithmetic series?
- A : arithmetic sequence - each term is equal to the previous term plus a common difference
- example : 5, 9, 13, 17,...
- recursive : a_{1} = 5
            - a_{n} = a_{n-1} + 4
- explicit : a_{n}=5 + 4(n-1)
##(9:10:26) Geometric Series
- Q : how do we find the sum of a geometric series?
- A : Geometric sequence - each term is equal to the previous term times a common ratio (r)
##(9:26:18) Mathematical induction
- Q : how do we prove formulas with series?
- A : induction : if it is free for 1, then it is free for 2
      induction : if it is free for 2, then it is free for 3
      induction : if it is free for 3, then it is free for 4
        ...
        ...
      if it true for k, then it is true for k + 1
