    -   persistency
    -   inter-related
    -   shared
-   university database :
    -   entities :
        -   students
        -   faculty
        -   courses

    -   summary :
        -   databases and database technology vital to modern organizations
        -   database technology supports daily operations and decision making
        -   understanding existing databses is crucial to query formulation
        -   emphasize structured data
        -   essential characteristics of shared, inter-related, and persistent

-   what organizational roles the interacting with database that you want to play

### non-procedural database acess

    - summary :
        - database technology is vital to modern organizations
        - crucial DBMS feature : nonprocedural access
        - query language, visual tool, form tool, report tool, and embedding
        - fundamental skill : **query formulation**

### transaction processing overview

-   what database transactions have you made today?
-   3 objectives :
    -   provide an example of a transaction that you use
    -   briefly explain key characteristics of database transactions
    -   explain the word 'transparency' for transaction processing services
-   whereas **production management** involves the control of **physical goods**
-   **transaction management** involves the control of **information goods**
-   so transactions are all or nothing meaning that all operations of a transaction must either succeed or the entire transaction is cancelled
-   support daily operations of an organization
-   collection of database operations
-   reliable and efficient processing of transactions as one unit of work
-   no lost data due to interference among mulitple users
-   recover from failures without loss of data for completed transactions

### data warehouse processing overview

-   lesson objectives :
    -   list three levels of decision making and at least one decision on each level
    -   define data warehouse
    -   explain at least one characteristic different for transaction processing versus business intelligence processing
-   reason for investing in an operational database
    -   faster processing
    -   larger volumes of business
    -   reduced personnel costs
-   data warehouse :
    -   term coined by william inmon in 1990
    -   refers to a logically centralized data repository where data from operational databases and other sources are integrated, cleaned and standardized to support business intelligence
-   benefits from a data warehouse :
    -   increased revenue and reduce expenses enabled by business analysis
    -   improved fraud detection
    -   improved customer attention to target marketing
    -   and reduction in inventory carrying cost through improved demend forecasting
-   a transaction typically updates only a few records
-   whereas a business intelligence application may query thousands to millions of records
-   business intelligence processing requires substantial daily processing using non-peak hours for transformations and integration
-   central repsitories in data warehouse usually can be populated from operational database and external sources
-   summary :
    -   data warehouse processing supports tactical and strategic decision making
    -   different DBMS features for business intelligence support

### DBMS techonology evolution video lecture

-   what company pioneered early advancements in relational database technology?
-   lesson objectives :
    -   appreciate the advances in database technology and the contribution of database technology to modern society
    -   list the major periods of database technology evolution and one advance ment in each period

### Basic of relational databases

-   lesson objectives :
    -   [ ] identify components in sample tables
- the concept of matching values is crucial in relational databases
- as you will see, relational databases typically contain many tables :
    - even a mono-sized database can have 10 to 15 tables
    - large databases can have hundreds of tables
- to extract meaningful information :
    - it is often necessary to combine multiple tables using matching values
