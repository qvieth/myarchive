# introduction to data wrangling and cleaning
- data wrangling = data munging
- data cleaning = data cleansing
- Both the above methods play an important role in __data pre-processing__ in machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

## Data Wrangling
- Data wrangling is the process of converting and mapping data from __raw format__ to a __better format__
- The job position of __data wrangler__ is a person who performs data wrangling and related tasks
- This also __includes visualizing the data__, __training a statistical model__ and __data aggregation__

- In data wrangling, the data is first __extracted from a data source__ in its raw format
- Next, this data is sent to an algorithm or __parsed__ into a predefined data structure
- The final step is __storing__ this data in a storage unit to use in the future
- Data scientists and business analysts analyze this data to make business decisions
- There are different tools for data wrangling, check the link provided in references
- Also, you can do it with python scripting.

- wrangling tools : Pandas
## Data Cleaning
- Data cleaning is the process of finding and __removing__ or __modifying__ incorrect and inaccurate records
- For example, some of the data that need cleansing are duplicate values, dummy values, absence of data, and contradictory data
- Moreover, this inconsistent data can occur due to corruption in transmission or storage

- Data cleaning can include activities such as removing typographical errors
- or validating and correcting values against a known list of entities
- Overall, data cleaning helps to clean the data set
- and to provide data inconsistency to different data sets that were merged for various data sources
