# binomial distribution
- Today we're going to discuss the __Binomial Distribution__
    - and a special case of this distribution known as a __Bernoulli Distribution__
- The __formulas that define these distributions__ provide us with
    - shortcuts for calculating the probabilities
    - of all kinds of events that happen in everyday life
- They can can also be used to help us look at how probabilities are connected!
    - For instance, knowing the chance of getting a flat tire today is useful
        - but knowing the likelihood of getting one this year, or in the next five years, may be more useful
- And heads up, this episode is going to have a lot more equations than normal, but to sweeten the deal, we added zombies!
