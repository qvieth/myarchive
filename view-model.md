          - software architecture
          - or enterprise architecture
- A [view](view) is a representation of a whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns
- Since the early 1990s there have been a number of efforts
     - to prescribe **approaches** for
          - describing
          - and analyzing system architectures
- These recent efforts define a set of [views](view) (or viewpoints)
- Usually a view is a work [product](product) that presents specific architecture data for a given system
     - However, the same term is sometimes used to refer to a view definition including
          - the particular viewpoint
          - and the corresponding guidance
     - that defines each concrete view
     - The term view model is related to **view** definitions
