# recession hyperinflation and stagflation
- Main outtakes of this lesson
1. Hyperinflation - when a country experiences a monthly inflation rate of over 50% or around 13,000% annual inflation.
    - Extreme inflation also forces people to spend as quickly as possible rather than save of lend, so there is no money available to fund new businesses. And all that uncertainty limits foreign investment and trade. 
    - The more money you print, the more inflation you get.
    - Economists call the number of times a dollar is spent per year a velocity of money. When people spend their money as quickly as they get it, that increases velocity, which pushes inflation up even faster. 
2. Depression.
    - After the initial crash in 1929 the federal reserve dropped interest rates to zero, output and prices fell, and regular people started to expect further price declines. Unemployment rose to 25% and the average family income dropped by around 40%.
3. Stagflation - when output slows down or stops, or stagnates at the same time that prices rise. Stagnant economy + inflation = stagflation.
    - The FED tried to address this by boosting the money supply and cutting interest rates, but output couldn't rise much because of low productivity and the oil shortage. So all that extra money just triggered inflation.
