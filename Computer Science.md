# Computer Science (and whatever related)
- what important : buy and sell : problem and solution : pain and product
- __what important in programming__ : abstraction, documentation, reverse engineering, black box, 50% understanding
-  To be Elon Musk, you have to completely understand what you are building and know it inside and out, whatever the field may be
    - The only reason he can sell it so well is because he __knows his products so well__

- i just start realize some important things about documentation, books - Fri Nov 20 2020
- if you want to learn about performance : read about bytecode passed into virtual machine - machine code
- you thought you understand but you're not, the abstraction trick you as you understand it but when dig deeper, it's not
- implementation : a unit of task of a language : ie. the __implementation__ of python is slower than the __implementation__ of C, can't say Python is slower than C
