## 1. What is engineering?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btGYcizV0iI&list=PLH2l6uzC4UEVUmJdTMStYXad_sI73_T0x&index=2
- 4 main branch :
    - civil
    * mechanical
    - electrical
    - chemical
    - many others developing their own fields :
        - aerospace, software,.many others developing : aerospace, software,...
        - environmental engineering : uses engineering practices, soil science, biology, chemistry to help find solutions to environmental problems
        - 2 of the more prominent disciplines : industrial and biomedical 


## 2. Civil engineering
- most ancient types of engineering : focus on structure and building of all kinds
- **structural** engineering and **construction** engineering
- city planning
- transportation
- sanitation

## 3. Mechanical engineering
- design, construction, operation, maintenance of machines and mechanical systems - pretty much any thing that moves
- steam engine
- air craft
- robotics and biomechanics

## 4. Electrical engineering
- magnetism
- electrical conduction
- telegraphy
- lighting
- computers

## 5. The history of chemical engineering
- george davis : father of mechanical engineering
- chemical refineries/ factory
- emerging fields
- renewable energy
- M.E is full of physics and math

## *6. Biomedical & Industrial engineering
* many insight in this lesson
- just as mechanical engineers work with bunch of different parts to design a machine
- industrial work with many different elements to devise an efficient system
- it's not just the machines they have to think about, they also have to consider the workers, materials, energy flow, and communication that are needed to provide the best product or service
- other branches of engineering often take apart each system and analyze all of its parts separately before putting a system together
- but industrial engineer do them differently:
    - they look at the system as a whole first and then move on to see how the different parts work together
    - then they can focus on the specifics to achieve the best results
    - it's all about **optimization**
```
- one of the most important areas that industrial engineers try to optimize is the **assembly line**
    - it's where we can see the biggest improvements in quality, delivery-time, and cost
```
- what we've learn :
    - industrial engineering
    - Frederick winslow taylor : father of industrial engineering and **scientific management**
    - biomedical engineering : artificial limb
    - bioengineering
    - the future of biomedical

## 7. The law of conservation
```
matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed
```
* we can use this law to figure out both where our box isn't operating as efficiently as it can be, and how to fix it
* box - input => output
    * conversion rate 60% => waste 40%
    * yield 30% => waste 70%
    * accumulation = input - ouput + generation - consumption
        * this equation is essential to engineering

## *8. reversibility & irreversibility
```
work = force * distance
```
- there are different types of work you're likely to encounter as an engineer
    - but with all of them the idea is that by putting work into a system
    - you can get some work out of it
    - usually in a more useful form
        - pressure-volume work 
```
a lot of engineering is about *optimizing* your machine and
processes to produce the most amount of work with as little input
as possible
```
- *efficiency
- what we've learn :
    - efficient machines and processes
    - heat and work(any type of other energy other than heat)
    * reversibility and irreversibility

## 9. The first & zeroth laws of thermodynamics
- thermodynamics : branch of physics and engineering
- converting energy often in the form of heat and work
- it describes how thermal energy is  converted to and from other forms of energy and also to work

## 10. Why we can't invent a perfect engine
=> entropy
```
in fact, every real-world energy conversion has some amount
of energy that changes into a form that's unavailable to do work
, and this less-usable engergy that's lost is usually heat
```
