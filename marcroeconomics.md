- focus on this lesson if you want to tackle unemployment problem
- Main outtakes of this lesson
- it wasn't until the Great Depression in the 1930's that economists fully apreciated the need for a systematic way to measure the overall economy, and that we might need theories to guide policies and fix potential problems
1. Macroeconomics - the study of the entire economy as a whole rather than individual markets : economic output, unemployment, inflation, interest rate, government policies
2. In general policy makers try to achieve three goals:
    - Keep the economy growing over time (__gross domestic product - GDP__)
    - Limit unemployment (__unemployment rate__)
    - Keep prices stable (__inflation rate__)
3. GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country's border in a specific period of time, usually a year 
    - Transactions where nothing new was produced - don't count as GDP
    - Also not including illegal activities
    - Measured in dollars
    - Nominal GDP is GDP not adjusted for inflation
    - Real GDP is GDP adjusted for inflation
4. Recession - when two successful quarters, or six months, show a decrease in real GDP
    - Depression - a severe recession
5. Unemployment rate is calculated by taking the number of people that are unemployed and dividing by the number of people in the labor force, times 100
    - Discouraged workers - unemployed people that were looking for work, but have given up
    - There are three types of unemployment:
        - frictional unemployment - the time period between jobs, when a worker is searching for, or transitioning from one job to another
        - structural unemployment - unemployment caused by lack of demand for a worker's specific type of labor
        - cyclical unemployment - unemployment due to recession
    - Natural rate of unemployment - the lowest rate of unemployment that economy can sustain over a long period
6. Inflation - an increase in a currency supply relative to the number of people using it, resulting in rising prices of goods and services over time
    - Deflation - a decrease in general price level of goods and services
