# Data Science Foundations
- Programming 💻: Your first task will be to choose either you’ll use Python or R (I’ll leave you some help here, here and here) and then immerse yourself into coding
- Linear Algebra 📐: As you’ll be working with data you’ll want to know how to represent data sets as matrices, and understand concepts like vectorization and orthogonality
- Calculus 🔗: Many of the models you’ll write and use will use tools like derivatives, integrals and optimization to compute and find a solution to your problem more rapily
- Probability 🎲: While you use data science, many times you’ll be working to predict something in the future so you’ll want to know how likely something is to happen or why two events are related
- Statistics 📊: In order to describe the information you’ll be analyzing, things like the mean or percentiles will come in handy, also tests to check your hypothesis will appear along the way
- Machine Learning 🤖: Maybe the core of data science, at some point during your project you’ll want to predict something and that’s when machine learning kicks in
