# recursive
-   a third way to define a sequence is to use recursion, as was done in example 5.3.3, 5.4.2, 5.4.3
-   Defining sequences recursively is similar to proving theorems by mathematical induction - discrete math book page 325

    -   recursion : algebra -> sequence | discrete math -> induction and recursion
