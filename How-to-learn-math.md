# EDX - How to learn math 
* make mistake, create synapse firing, brain grow
* think **slower**, deeper, think about connection, do not think fast
    * ask more question : why does this work
    * our triangles and fraction are also connected to the big topic of rate, rate is a special kind of fraction or ratio where different units are used, eg **miles per hour**
    * RATE CAN BE GRAPH AS RIGHT TRIANGLE
    * from number to algebra to geometry, all link to 1 big idea
        * MATHEMATICAL PROPOTIONS
        * when we study *fraction, rates, graphs* : 3/4 6/8 9/12
        * so all of these things are expressing a propotion or a relationship
        * never give up looking for mathematical connections + big ideas
        * they will really help you
    * making sense and intuition :
        * make question like : how does it work, how does it connected to other methods of math
    * fractions : a relationship :
        * any multiplication can be graphed as area table of a square
        * big idea 1 : no matter how big numerator or denominator is, fraction show how big they are in relation to each other 
    * **IDEAS VS MEMORIZATION** :
        * understanding math is often less about getting lots of small questions
        * it's about whether you learn the big idea
        * math is a subject with a few general principles that are important to understand
        * teachers give problems to illustrate the general principles but many students get lost in the details
    * fibonacci sequence :
    * logarithmic pattern : 
    * what employers don't need is people who calculate fast
    * calculations are done by calculators and computers
    * what is needed is people who can be creative with math, work as a team, and problem solve
    * math is about problem solving, reasoning, using intuition, and making connections
    * stereotype : math person, literature person, fuck that
    * for doing survey, you can't just ask people for giving their time do the survey, you have to give something, like a free course or lesson, then ask them back
