# random variables and discrete probability distribution MAS

-   random variable
    -   variable whose value is determined by a random experiment
    -   just an outcome of an experiment
-   discrete probability distribution
    -   table or formula that lists
        -   the probabilities for each **outcome** of the random variable
    -   X
-   ex : flip 3 coins at the same time, let random variable X be heads showing

    -   discrete probability distribution :
        -   HHH -> 3 heads
        -   HHT -> 2 heads
        -   HTH -> 2 heads
        -   HTT -> 1 heads
        -   THH -> 2 heads
        -   THT -> 1 heads
        -   TTH -> 1 heads
        -   TTT -> 0 heads

-   when your teacher tell you to create probability distribution this is what you gonna do:

| x      | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | heads |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| P(X=x) | 1/8 | 3/8 | 3/8 | 1/8 |       |

-   so we look at the distribution or the spread of the probabilities
    -   among all the possible outcomes of this experiment
-   distribution = spread
-   discrete probability distribution : X is discrete
-   non-discrete : height measure

*   this is extremely important : the sum of all of the probabilities in our distribution equal 1
* this kind of mental image that you built what a distribution is of probabilities will carry on as we do all of the different kinds of problems
