    - [ ] Understand what machine learning is
    - [ ] Use scikit-learn effectively to implement a variety of supervised learning models
    - [ ] Recognize the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
    - [ ] Create regression models, including linear regression and multiple linear regression
    - [ ] Use past user data to predict Yelp ratings
    - [ ] Build k-nearest neighbors classifiers
    - [ ] Evaluate and improve your supervised model
    - [ ] Implement and train logistic regression and Naive Bayes classifiers
    - [ ] Create advanced classifiers with SVMs, Decision Trees, and Random Forests
    - [ ] Classify Twitter data using a variety of supervised models
