- **TECHNIQUES OF ALGORITHM DESIGN AND ANALYSIS**
- [x] theory of computation - comeback after done maths
- numerical vs symbolic work - computing - model?
- finish geometry, trigonometry then comeback to calculus, linear algebra, statistics, algorithms & data structure

- study linear algebra -> calculus -> statistics
- why you want to study math? - i use math for reasoning, for learning faster, making sense and remembering longer
  WP:start
  logic is reasonable
  endgoal of any subject study : STUDY THROUGH BOOK ONLY : encapsulation -> best for look back
  BEOFRE LEARN ANY NEW SUBJECT, QUORA FOR 'HOW TO STUDY THAT SUBJECT'
  QUORA IS BEST ROADMAP
  ALWAYS ASK WHAT WAS THE BAD PART THAT I DID
  NOT THE KNOWLEDGE BUT HOW TO NAVIGATE TO KNOWLEDGE
- organize thought process with pen and paper - like how you study React

17. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntax
18. PREPARE - when something would make you panic, think of searching youtube for a way to deal with it e.g. meet girlfriend parents

- technology - collective learning - technological progress -> [crash course big history](crash-course-big-history)
     - technology -> progress | engineer -> process
- oportunity cost : LEARN HOW TO READ THE DOCUMENT - not learn the document - do anything, like watching youtube, reading other things, just to learn to read the document
     - learn from course (like 6hrs)(not small video) - do a research on types of video in relation with grasping rate vs reading docs
     - real projects, long courses video is good for BIG PICTURE grasping
     - always speed up video
- Object-oriented studying - modular studying
- i have not failed, i have only found out 10000 ways that won't work
- on my way of self learning, google learning, i realize 1 important things :
     - it's not about the answer, asking question is everything, asking the right question is the key
- collaboration is about understanding : -> my framework
     - my communicating framework : get inspired by UML : 1st : goal image, 2nd : lack, 3rd : talk without thinking
     - i'm writing things while talking not for you to see, but for both of us to see, to make me evaluate my own thinking, sometimes i think it is too fast, can't keep track in a short period of times
- always ask yourself : in the next 3 hours, what knowledge will i gain
- look for the 'image of the notion first', then find the language and symbol to describe that 'image of notion' later
- how to represent lists...
- what is ordered list?
- communicating : outcomes{goal{what |though, ideas, concept| you want to transfer to target}}
     - > > wrong, youtube, google more for experts solution
- my career choice : toward web technologies -> data science -> finance -> my own company
-
- search for python equivalent of JS, then try to understand the python

- tree | set
- reverse engineering + studying from big ideas down
- cv :

- [ ] current goal : connecting math and programming concepts for interview preparing -> this goal suck

- what to do next day : learn math with programming

* [x] you thought you understand but you're not, the abstraction trick you as you understand it but when dig deeper, it's not
* [x] domain knowledge vs general knowledge?
     - [x] in software engineer, domain knowledge is knowledge about the environment in which the target system operates
* [ ] [api vs sdk](https://nordicapis.com/what-is-the-difference-between-an-api-and-an-sdk/)
* [ ] [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming)
* [ ] linear problems vs non-linear problem
* [x] echo chamber
* [x] dunning - kruger effect : the more you know about something, the less you know about it => you must always be humble
* [ ] [skills needed for data scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em8nBc-zRaM)
* [x] ETL : extract tranform load
* [x] great insight :
     - [x] When you are looking for a job in industry, you should not even mention LaTex on your CV
     - [x] because it shows a big **lack of understanding of industry standards and productivity oriented procedures**
* [x] learn pandoc + latex
* [ ] dopamine : - relax - easy - more tolerance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QiE-M1LrZk
* [x] halo effect
* [ ] [10 cognitive bias](https://www.verywellmind.com/cognitive-biases-distort-thinking-2794763)
* [x] features and target variables
* [ ] [computational finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_finance)
* [ ] [top 100 theorem](http://pirate.shu.edu/~kahlnath/Top100.html)
* [ ] [Interactive Data Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsfWtPH2kDg) : many insight for DS
* [ ] data science hierarchy of needs, google auto ML https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQq8DwEJeoU
* read book like watching a video
* google analytics
* study literature - writing style,...
* bias - systematic error
* **writing styles, citation styles**
* [o] When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem
     - [x] most of the time it's less a matter of knowing the answer
     - [x] as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer
     - [ ] => here's my take : everything should be balance : knowledge and how to search for knowledge
* learn asynchronous communicating : email
* learn lua for scripting with vim
* [ ] DO THIS 1 THING : LEARN ABILITY TO **READ DOCS**, ALWAYS REMIND YOUR SELF HOW TO READ THE DOC EASIER AND LATER WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE TO THE NEEDED PART
     - currently i think read doc don't need to be read official doc, navigate to whatever doc should be consider
* how is this function? => van hanh - he thong => function - system
     - y = f(x) : input - output
     - domain - set
* [x] crash course algebra | Fri Jan 22 09:55:44 AM +07 2021
* [x] wiki-navigate-linkedlist-**readbook** | Thu Jan 14 03:38:27 PM +07 2021
* [x] The reason for this is not everything in a book has the same level of important
     - [x] so it makes no sense to read them at a fixed gear
     - [x] That's what active reading is, and speed reading is active reading
     - [x]    - imagination

- [ ] think : where did the one teach you get the knowledge? of course it's from the docs, so only read docs
