## FLEETING NOTES

-   probability - distribution - the number 'one'
-   statistical question vs non-statistical question
-   https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/z-score/ : z-score

    -   low standard deviation means that the data is very closely related to the average, thus very reliable
    -   high standard deviation means that there is a large variance between the data and the statistical average, and is not as reliable

        -   as far as the hypothesis testing itself the actual method is basically exactly the same as what we've doing before :
            1. lockdown the rejection regions
            2. calculate the test statistics
            3. see where test statistic falls
            4. determine if reject or fail to reject
