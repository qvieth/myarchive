5. supervised learning
    - MNIST datasets => hand written digits
    * supervised : use labeled data to tell new data right or wrong
6. unsupervised learning
    - clustering
    - guess the pattern like humans
    - find meaningful pattern with AI
        - k-means clustering 
            1. predict
            2. learn
    - representation learning happens both in supervised and unsupervised learning models
        - build representation of images
    - autoenconder : reconstruct pizza image
    - we all know unsupervised learning is the answer
7. NLP
    - NL understanding
    - NL generation
    - distributional semantics
    - **to make computer understand distributional semantics, we have to express the concept in math**
        - one simple technique is count vectors
        - encoder-decoder for word
    - recurrent neural network (RNN)
8. 
9. reinforcement learning
    - task even us don't fully understand - complicated 
    - reward : good job signal
    - agent
    - environment
10. *symbolic AI
- symbol & propositional logic
- over the years, we've created knowledge base for banks, insurance companies and other industries to make important decisions
- these AI systems are called expert systems
- expert system vs neural network
    - expert systems make conclusions based on logic and reason, not just trial-and-error guesses like a neural network
    - an expert system can explain its decisions by showing which parts were evaluated as true or false

1. AI playing games
    - montecarlo tree search
    - evolutionary neural networks
    - genetic algorithm
        - random mutations

web search
- knowledge base
