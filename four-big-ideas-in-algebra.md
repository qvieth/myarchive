# four big ideas in algebra
- https://mrhonner.com/archives/11406   
- In his controversial post criticizing high school algebra, Grant Wiggins issued a challenge to his readers:
>   Can you identify 4 big ideas in algebra,
    ideas that not only provide a powerful set
    of intellectual priorities for the course
    but that have rich connections to other fields?
    Doubt it.
    
    
## 1. algebraic structure
- mathematical object
- algebra : essentially a set of mathematical objects
    - that can be both added and multiplied 
    - with the two operations endow a rich and powerful structure on the set of object
- the existence, the interplay, of these operations
- endow a rich and powerful structure on the set of objects:
    - “Algebraic structure” includes precisely things like “the
        - associative
        - commutative
        - and distributive properties”
    - along with the definitions of
        - addition
        - and multiplication
    - **with the two operations fitting together via the distributive property**
- the existence, and interplay, of these operations endow a rich and powerful structure on the set of objects : an algebraic structure 

- These are
    - group theory
    - field theory
    - and other branches of abstract algebra
    - for math majors
- They are big ideas, and they are not limited to just arithmetic
- In linear algebra we see that matrix multiplication is associative, but not commutative, for example

## 2. binary relations
