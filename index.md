## quick note
* [ ] my principles :
    1. [ ] 50% understanding : mermorizing + connecting
    2. [ ] reverse classification system : categorization | abstraction - specification
    3. [ ] how to navigate to the knowledge > knowledge
    4. [ ] communicating : outcomes{goal{what |though, ideas, concept| you want to transfer to target}}
    5. [ ] imagination : <= do this everywhere : read book like watching a video
    6. [ ] epistemology : value of knowledge
    7. [ ] no need to go fast with foundation knowledge 
    8. [ ] i just realize how my brain react when i meet so many things new/diffcult/alreadyforgot
8. [ ] usefel knowledge = **right** information acquisition * time spent
- slope = rise/run = ds/dt = v
