# My note
## quick note
* [ ] my principles :
    1. [ ] 50% understanding : mermorizing + connecting
    2. [ ] reverse classification system : categorization | abstraction - specification
    3. [ ] how to navigate to the knowledge > knowledge
    4. [ ] communicating : outcomes{goal{what |though, ideas, concept| you want to transfer to target}}
    5. [ ] imagination : <= do this everywhere : read book like watching a video
    6. [ ] epistemology : value of knowledge
    7. [ ] no need to go fast with foundation knowledge 
    8. [ ] i just realize how my brain react when i meet so many things new/diffcult/alreadyforgot
    9. [ ] for visualization(or anything) : code should be the last thing to be paid attention, focus on the process, ideas
- slope = rise/run = ds/dt = v
- [X] theory of computation - comeback after done maths
- numerical vs symbolic work - computing - model?
- finish geometry, trigonometry then comeback to calculus, linear algebra, statistics, algorithms & data structure
