    -   key to practice social skills :
        1. narrow down your focus to a particular context
        2. find a way to engage in that environment at a higher-than-average rate
        3. if possible, get a peer or coach to give you feedback

-   [the power of vulnerability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o)

    -   why we're living is about connection
    -   connection = shame and fear
        -   shame : fear of disconnection
        -   is there something about me that
            -   if other people know it or see it
            -   i won't be worthy of connection
        -   the less you talk about it, the more you have it
        -   i don't ... enough
        -   the thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability
    -   shame all boils down to
    -   one variable that seperated the people who
        -   have a strong sense of love and belonging
        -   and the people who really struggle for it
    -   the people who have the strong senese of love and belonging is
        -   they believe they're worthy of love and belonging
        -   courage != bravery
        -   embrace vulnerable = what make them vulnerable make them beautiful
    -   numb emotions -> numb everything including happiness -> miserable -> numb emotion -> cycle
    -   we make the uncertain certain
    -   blame = a way to discharge pain and discomfort
    -   say we're sorry, we'll fix it
    -   'i'm enough' - kinder to ourself and to others

-   [5 simple habits that will make you a better communicator](https://www.businessinsider.com/5-simple-habits-that-will-make-you-a-better-communicator-2016-2)

    1. gain clarity :
        - all communications are either about enabling or persuading(inform or empower)
    2. listen :
        - the more you know about what your audience thinks and perceives,
        - the more you will connect and engage with them
    3. use body language :
        - this can increase your confidence
    4. be brief :
        - most people have an attention span of 8 seconds
        - another way to be brief is to use the power of pause
        - 3 to 5 seconds pause is good for reframe, dim the exciment that inspire you to over-talk
    5. keep practicing

    -   When all three (passion, practice & education) are combined then a superstar is born
-   mistake - cannot - mustn't :
    -   resuming the break up conversation
    -   playing the victim
    -   asking the match
    -   clarifying you're not just friends

a wise man doesn't give the right answers, he poses the right questions
STRUCTURE : TOP - QUICK NOTE, MIDDLE - IMPORTANT NOTE, BOTTOM - ORGANIZED NOTE
WP:start
logic is reasonable
endgoal of any subject study : STUDY THROUGH BOOK ONLY : encapsulation -> best for look back
GOT REJECTED BY MINDX - 8/4
BEOFRE LEARN ANY NEW SUBJECT, QUORA FOR 'HOW TO STUDY THAT SUBJECT'
QUORA IS BEST ROADMAP
ALWAYS ASK WHAT WAS THE BAD PART THAT I DID
NOT THE KNOWLEDGE BUT HOW TO NAVIGATE TO KNOWLEDGE
```

1. **USE IT OR LOSE IT** :D -> forget everything after understand it
2. RULE OF 3 : ANYTHING CAN BE COMPOSED OF 3 OR LESS ELEMENTS
3. the first thing when you start learning a new subject : learn new vocabulary, key terms
4. meaning of words - different based on **context**
5. communication : MO THAN KET + paraphrase
6. **find structure for everything** - communication **structure** :
    1. problem -> solution -> benefits
    2. what? -> so what? -> now what?
    3. issue -> illustration -> invitation
7. 2 approaches : bottom-up - top-down (page 13 - mathematics for machine learning)(should combine this)
8. classification tree - how to navigate to the knowledge > knowledge
9. understand architecture -> read API -> code
10. level of complexity -> if low, skip, high, pay attention and focus the math concept
11. KEYWORD : FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ... | BIG IDEAS OF ... | ... CHEATSHEET | ... CALCULATOR | ... NOTATION | ... COOKBOOK | ... BOILERPLATE/IMPLEMENTAION
12. [I find that learning node.js is difficult for me. Can someone give me an advice?](https://www.quora.com/I-find-that-learning-node-js-is-difficult-for-me-Can-someone-give-me-an-advice)
    - do similar search
13. LEARN TO ASK **BETTER QUESTION** :
    - GOOGLE/**WIKI** HOW TO LEARN ABOUT SOMETHING FIRST RATHER THAN GOOGLE FOR THE THING ITSELF
        - ex : how to learn statistics, how to learn nodejs,...
    - sometimes think about history of a problem
        - https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-react-js-on-a-timeline/ : react history -> google for similar topics of other technology
14. Both **discovery** and **proof** are integral parts of **problem solving**
15. discrete math -> discrete structure -> modeling problems
16. looping - quantification : \forall \exists
17. abduction - sherlock - 'when you have eliminated the immpossible, whatever remains however improbable must be the truth'
18. don't look at things as they have 2 face, look at them as they have 4 face, reduce the posibility and acquire true knowledge
19. rewrite wiki in project based module - knowledge is encapsulated in project based
20. programming : types are object, functions are morphisms | a -> b -> b | arrow : f = a -> b, id_b = b -> b | id_b after f
21. code only when you already understand the concept
