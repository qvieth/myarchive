STRUCTURE : TOP - QUICK NOTE, MIDDLE - IMPORTANT NOTE, BOTTOM - ORGANIZED NOTE
WP:start
logic is reasonable
endgoal of any subject study : STUDY THROUGH BOOK ONLY : encapsulation -> best for look back
```

## top

```
this should be empty
```

## middle

1. **USE IT OR LOSE IT** :D -> forget everything after understand it
2. the first thing when you start learning a new subject : learn new vocabulary, key terms
3. meaning of words - different based on **context**
4. **find structure for everything** - communication **structure** :
    1. problem -> solution -> benefits
    2. what? -> so what? -> now what?
    3. issue -> illustration -> invitation
5. 2 approaches : bottom-up - top-down (page 13 - mathematics for machine learning)(should combine this)
6. classification tree - how to navigate to the knowledge > knowledge
7. code should be the last thing to be paid attention, focus on the process, ideas
8. level of complexity -> if low, skip, high, pay attention and focus the math concept
9. keyword : FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ... | BIG IDEAS OF ... | ... CHEATSHEET | ... CALCULATOR | ... NOTATION | ... COOKBOOK
10. [I find that learning node.js is difficult for me. Can someone give me an advice?](https://www.quora.com/I-find-that-learning-node-js-is-difficult-for-me-Can-someone-give-me-an-advice)
    - do similar search
11. LEARN TO ASK **BETTER QUESTION** :
    - GOOGLE/**WIKI** HOW TO LEARN ABOUT SOMETHING FIRST RATHER THAN GOOGLE FOR THE THING ITSELF
        - ex : how to learn statistics, how to learn nodejs,...
    - sometimes think about history of a problem
        - https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-react-js-on-a-timeline/ : react history -> google for similar topics of other technology
12. Both **discovery** and **proof** are integral parts of **problem solving**
13. discrete math -> discrete structure -> modeling problems
14. looping - quantification : \forall \exists
15. abduction - sherlock - 'when you have eliminated the immpossible, whatever remains however improbable must be the truth'
16. don't look at things as they have 2 face, look at them as they have 4 face, reduce the posibility and acquire true knowledge
17. rewrite wiki in project based module - knowledge is encapsulated in project based
18. programming : types are object, functions are morphisms | a -> b -> b | arrow : f = a -> b, id_b = b -> b | id_b after f
