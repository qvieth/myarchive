## principles

```
concept : an abstract idea, a general notion
if you can't categorize, tag the ideas, you're not understanding it
do project(program) along category(package) <- intermediate packets
understand <- question
practice asking better question, ask question iteratively
sometimes, just reformulating the problem leads to better solution
think programming as all around variable
variable is value, function, object...
output(goal) of a program is to transform variable => variable
think of a program as a black box that tranform a variable => a variable
