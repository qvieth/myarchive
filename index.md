- [Fundamentals of Computing Specialization - There are 7 Courses in this Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals#courses)
  - [principles of computing](principles-of-computing)
- [introduction to logic full course](introduction-to-logic-full-course)
- [book introduction to logic irving copi](book-introduction-to-logic-irving-copi)
- 
- [draft](draft)
- build your own x
- good source from snap token
  - https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/ -> kilo text editor in C
  - https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/similarTutorials.html -> similar tutorials
- [how can i learn dsa in c](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-learn-Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-in-C-language)
  - I would start with writing the basics from scratch in C:
    - Data Structures
    - vector
    - linked list
    - binary search tree
    - hash table
    - adjacency matrix
    - adjacency list
  - Algorithms
    - ...
- [Caleb Curry](Caleb-Curry)
- [Cpp](Cpp)
- [C](C)

- Data Structures and Algorithms in C
  - So there are 2 things, I want to learn Data Structures and Algorithms
  - and want to implement them in C language
  - So I should know the C language well, specially what requires for implementation
  - I would suggest you to have good understanding of pointers and pointer to structure
  - Now come to Data Structures and Algorithms, we have to understand variety of Data Structures and Algorithms
  - - Algorithm Analysis, Linked List, Stack & Queue, Tree, Graph, Sorting, Searching and Hashing
  - They are not related to any language. So understand the concepts well and then implement it in C language
- ===BIG IDEA=== :
- black box-rized knowledge <- BID IDEA think about RISC chips when learning hardware Caleb Curry
  - = scope the knowledge
  - combine with the model :
- Caleb Curry - computer science : 4 layer :
- static : can't be changed
- dynamic : can be changed

```
    | user         |

    | applications |

    | OS           |

    | hardware     |
```

- between each of these layers is interface(how each layer communicate to each other)
- ===END OF BIG IDEA===

## principles

```
concept : an abstract idea, a general notion
if you can't categorize, tag the ideas, you're not understanding it
do project(program) along category(package) <- intermediate packets
understand <- question
practice asking better question, ask question iteratively
sometimes, just reformulating the problem leads to better solution

think programming as all around variable => also consider which paradigm
variable is value, function, object...
output(goal) of a program is to transform variable => variable
think of a program as a black box that tranform a variable => a variable
you don't just fix the symptom you have to fix the root cause

point system : to eliminate 2 polar(true,false|have,don't have) : 10
programming book structure : concepts(why 10 and what 10) and real app coding(how 10 and what 5)
when read book focus on concepts,skim real app coding and later learn with videos
