## middle

1. **USE IT OR LOSE IT** :D -> forget everything after understand it
2. modeling mathematically
3. Object-oriented studying - modular studying
4. 2 approaches : bottom-up - top-down (page 13 - mathematics for machine learning)(should combine this)
5. classification tree - how to navigate to the knowledge > knowledge
6. communicating : outcomes{goal{what |though, ideas, concept| you want to transfer to target}}
7. collaboration is about understanding : -> my framework
    - my communicating framework : get inspired by UML : 1st : goal image, 2nd : lack, 3rd : talk without thinking
    - i'm writing things while talking not for you to see, but for both of us to see, to make me evaluate my own thinking, sometimes i think it is too fast, can't keep track in a short period of times
8. code should be the last thing to be paid attention, focus on the process, ideas
9. level of complexity -> if low, skip, high, pay attention and focus the math concept
10. aware of your own blackbox
11. keyword : FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ... | BIG IDEAS OF ... | ... CHEATSHEET | ... CALCULATOR | ... NOTATION | ... COOKBOOK
12. technology - collective learning - technological progress -> [crash course big history](crash-course-big-history)
    - technology -> progress | engineer -> process
13. there's no one size fit all
14. start new subject with video, later documents
15. i have not failed, i have only found out 10000 ways that won't work
16. PREPARE - when something would make you panic, think of searching youtube for a way to deal with it e.g. meet girlfriend parents
17. oportunity cost : LEARN HOW TO READ THE DOCUMENT - not learn the document - do anything, like watching youtube, reading other things, just to learn to read the document
    - learn from course (like 6hrs)(not small video) - do a research on types of video in relation with grasping rate vs reading docs
    - real projects, long courses video is good for BIG PICTURE grasping
    - always speed up video
    - JS promises
    - callback, arrow functions - middleware function(1,2,next) vs route handler callback
18. search for python equivalent of JS, then try to understand the python
19. async/await is the best way to express asynchronous I/O in combination with using an event loop
20. event loop: when A happens, do B
21. Think of async/await as an **API for asynchronous programming**
22. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntax
23. CALLBACK FUNCTION AKA HANDLER FUNCTION
24. [I find that learning node.js is difficult for me. Can someone give me an advice?](https://www.quora.com/I-find-that-learning-node-js-is-difficult-for-me-Can-someone-give-me-an-advice)
    ] do similar search
25. LEARN TO ASK QUESTION <- focus on asking question only
26. on my way of self learning, google learning, i realize 1 important things :
    ] it's not about the answer, asking question is everything, asking the right question is the key
27. PROJECT -> BREAKDOWN
28. [Is it possible to append to innerHTML without destroying descendants' event listeners?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/595808/is-it-possible-to-append-to-innerhtml-without-destroying-descendants-event-list)
29. [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm)
30. closure of a function : a variable act like arugment but cannot be passed as parameter
31. programming : types are object, functions are morphisms | a -> b -> b | arrow : f = a -> b, id_b = b -> b | id_b after f
32. [category theory](category-theory) :
    - our tools for describing things : composition - abstraction - identity
    - compostion and identity they just define category theory
    - category is bunch of objects | objects just identify the end of arrow(functions) - they don't serve other purpose
    * different composition table give you different categories
    * objects and arrows don't have structure, they don't contain information, their composition contain information
    - things are chopable
    - sets and functions between sets
    - think of the 2 square image and the arrows
33. composition of functions is associative
34. how to represent lists...
35. what is ordered list?
36. 7 primitive types of data : string, number, array, set, true, false, null
37. GOOGLE HOW TO LEARN ABOUT SOMETHING FIRST RATHER THAN GOOGLE FOR THE THING ITSELF
    - or you can just **WIKI** it
38. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_logic
39. https://www.quora.com/What-should-one-do-to-study-mathematical-logic
40. Both discovery and proof are integral parts of problem solving
41. For complex problems, the interplay between discovery and proof is not reserved to the end
42. of the problem-solving process but, rather, is an important part of each step.4.
43. to my friend : to study math, you cannot just listen to my vietnamese words, you will have to read the book in english, understand and remember the word yourself
44. loop : thik of mathematical induction(sequences) with pre and post conditions
    1. a_n = frac{-1^n}{n+1} for every interger n \geq 0
    2. -> BIG IDEA : THINK OF THE FORMULA FIRST, NOT THE FOR FIRST
45. a third way to define a sequence is to use recursion, as was done in example 5.3.3, 5.4.2, 5.4.3
46. Defining sequences recursively is similar to proving theorems by mathematical induction - discrete math book page 325
47. Recursive Thinking : The process of solving large problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler problems that have identical forms.
48. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PaL3GKL6U : good video - think about what not how, post condition not recursive part
49. For sequential circuits one cannot predict the output corresponding to a particular input, unless one knows the state the circuit was in
50. Each piece of input to a finite-state automaton leads to a change in the state of the automaton
51. A finite-state automaton A **consists of five objects**:
    1. A finite **set** I, called the **input** alphabet, of input symbols
    2. A finite **set** S of **states** the automaton can assume
    3. A designated state s 0 called the **initial state**
    4. A designated set of states called the set of **accepting states**
    5. A next-state **function** N : S X I -> S that associates a “next-state” to each
        - ordered pair consisting of a “current state” and a “current input”
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuoDmiJ6zLQ : insight for finite state automata and regular expression
    - definition page 843
    * all regular expression can be represented as **state transition diagram**
    * https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~goddard/texts/theoryOfComputation/5.pdf
52. discrete math -> discrete structure -> modeling problems
53. logic puzzle -> quiz your girlfriend
54. when you feel you have some thing that could solve the problem but forget, don't try to call back that forgotten idea, try to reason back
55. looping - quantification
56. organize thought process with pen and paper - like how you study React
57. https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-react-js-on-a-timeline/ : react history -> google for similar topics of other technology
58. look for the 'image of the notion first', then find the language and symbol to describe that 'image of notion' later
59. abduction - sherlock - 'when you have eliminated the immpossible, whatever remains however improbable must be the truth'
60. don't look at things as they have 2 face, look at them as they have 4 face, reduce the posibility and acquire true knowledge
