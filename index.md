## principles

```
concept : an abstract idea, a general notion
if you can't categorize, tag the ideas, you're not understanding it
do project(program) along category(package) <- intermediate packets
understand <- question
practice asking better question, ask question iteratively
sometimes, just reformulating the problem leads to better solution

think programming as all around variable => also consider which paradigm
variable is value, function, object...
output(goal) of a program is to transform variable => variable
think of a program as a black box that tranform a variable => a variable
you don't just fix the symptom you have to fix the root cause

point system : to eliminate 2 polar(true,false|have,don't have) : 10
programming book structure : concepts(why 10 and what 10) and real app coding(how 10 and what 5)
when read book focus on concepts,skim real app coding and later learn with videos
