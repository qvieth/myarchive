# My note
"Rome wasn't built in a day"

## quick note
* [ ] my principles :
    1. [ ] **USE IT OR LOSE IT** :D -> forget everything after understand it
    5. [ ] tree | set
    2. [ ] Object-oriented studying
    3. [ ] reverse engineering + studying from big ideas down
    4. [ ] classification tree - how to navigate to the knowledge > knowledge
    6. [ ] communicating : outcomes{goal{what |though, ideas, concept| you want to transfer to target}}
    7. [ ] code should be the last thing to be paid attention, focus on the process, ideas
    8. [ ] level of complexity -> if low, skip, high, pay attention and focus the math concept
    9. [ ] aware of your own blackbox
    10. [ ] probability of 1 : see all the possibilities -> nothing can surpass 1 
    11. [ ] keyword : FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ... | BIG IDEAS OF ... | ... CHEATSHEET | ... CALCULATOR | ... NOTATION
    12. [ ] technology - collective learning - technological progress -> [crash course big history](crash-course-big-history)
        - technology -> progress , engineer -> process
    13. [ ] there's no one size fit all
