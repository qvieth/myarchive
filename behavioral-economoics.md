- loss aversion : people strongly want to avoid losing
- studies show that, in general, losses are more painful than gains are pleasurable
- so people might choose a safe course of action even if it's not the most logical choice

-Summary:

## "Lack of information"
Prices Send Signals and they can change perception. For example, given 2 ice creams tubs and the only information provided about them is their price. People tend to prefer the one with a higher price.

## "Manipulate non intrinsic attributes of price"
Contrary to basic assumptions of economics, marketing actions can successfully affect pleasantness by manipulating the non-intrinsic attributes of goods
For example given a a decent wine, increasing the price of the wine may actually create a demand, because people perceive wines with higher tags to be good wine. 

The idea that perception and passions influence our decisions also applies in finance, which explains the Dutch Tulip Mania in the 17th Century or the 2008 Financial Crisis in the US.

## "Framing effect"
If People were entirely rational they'd make the same decisions given identical option but sometimes their preferences are dependent on how the options are presented. Psychologists call this Cognitive bias or the Framing Effect.
For example people would prefer to eat beef which is 75%, fat free rather than beef having 25% fat. Also you'd buy a lottery ticket that say's 1 out of 1000 is a winner or 999 out of 1000 are looser.

Classical Economics argues that framing has little impact on decision making because most people are intelligent and rational but in the real world people can be very irrational.

A gym might break it's membership and call it 1$ a year. This may make it look a lot more affordable than paying 365$ a year. This is reason a TV worth 499.99 $ looks like a good deal rather than 500$. This is called psychological and it make people feel they're getting a good deal. 
However some high end retailers mark their prices in whole dollars, basically signalling their goods are of a higher quality.

## Nudge theory:
Nudge theory suggests that nudges actually makes people behave in a certain way without changing the choices available to them. For example to tackle the problem of child obesity, instead of changing the food choices available in a school cafeteria, rearranging the food choices in a cafeteria by putting fruits and veggies in the eye level shelf and desserts on the top level shelf actually lead to healthier eats patterns in a school. 

So Nudge theory works and it's changing how public policies can be implemented.


## Risk(neutral & averse)
Suppose is a choice of two sealed envelopes. One has  a hundred dollars, and one has no dollars. 

You can choose an envelope, or you can  take 50 bucks cash right now. 

So do you take the fifty bucks?  Or what about 49 bucks?  Now, this is unlikely to happen to you in  real life, but the exercise is about your  attitude towards risk. Since there’s a 50/50  chance of getting 100 bucks or nothing, the expected  return, or the average of the possible outcomes  is 50 bucks 
### Risk Neutral:
If you’re willing to accept $50 cash to  abandon the envelopes, then you’re risk neutral. 
### Risk Averse:
But If you accept less than $50, just to avoid walking away with nothing, then you’re risk-averse. 

Studies by Behavioral Economists about risk and loss aversion suggests that people strongly want to avoid losing. The Study suggests to people losses are more painful, than gains are pleasurable. So people might choose the safe course of action even if it's not the most logical choice.
For example loss aversion can help incentivise employees. Researchers subdivided a group of workers in 3 groups. The first group was control group and were not given any bonus. The second group was promised bonus at the end of the year based on performance. The third group was given the bonus at the start of the year and they were told they have to pay it back if they didn’t meet specific goals. The workers in the first and second groups  performed about the same. But the ones in the third group performed significantly better.

So people hate loosing. And account for emotion gives us a realistic view of how people actually behave.
