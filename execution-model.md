# execution model

- think of
     - [execution](execution) + [model](model)
- A [programming language](programming-language) **consists** of
     - a grammar/syntax
     - plus an **execution model**
- The execution model specifies the behavior of elements of the language
     - By applying the execution model, one can derive the behavior of a program
     - that was written in terms of that programming language
- For example
     - when a programmer "reads" code
          - in their mind, they walk through what each line of code does
          - In effect they simulate the behavior inside their mind
     - What the programmer is doing is applying the execution model to the code which results in the behavior of the code
- Each and every programming language has an execution model which determines
     - the manner in which the units of work
     - (that are indicated by program syntax)
     - are scheduled for execution
- Detailed examples of the specification of execution models of a few popular languages include those of
     - Python
     - the execution model of the Unified Parallel C (UPC) programming language
     - a discussion of various classes of execution model such as for imperative versus functional languages
     - and an article discussing execution models for real-time embedded languages
