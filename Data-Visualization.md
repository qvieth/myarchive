    - [ ] Understand and begin to apply exploratory data analysis techniques
    - [ ] Use Matplotlib to generate basic data visualizations
    - [ ] Generate more attractive data visualizations more easily with seaborn
    - [ ] Understand best practices for data visualization
- If you are interested in learning more about these topics, here are some additional resources:
