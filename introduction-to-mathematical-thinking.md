# introduction to mathematical thinking
- university math :
    - understanding not doing
    - not about right or wrong, but about how to think about the problems
    - why you get right or wrong is important
    - please read the document called BACKGROUND READING

## 1. introductory material
- read the BACKGROUND READING
- what kinds of patterns are studied in topology?
    - -> closeness
- in the nineteenth century, the primary focus in math became
    - -> concepts and relationship
- according to keith devlin, the most valuable mathematical ability in today's advanced nations is
    - -> adapt old methods or develop new ones
- the secret of this entire course is reflection, not completion
- which of the following was a major change in the nature of mathematics in the 19th century?
    - -> the main focus mathematics shifted from developing and using procedures to analyzing properties and relationships
    - mathematics became more abstract
* the main thing to realize is that a lot of what we do probably won't seem like doing math, since the focus is on how to think mathematically, not how to apply standard techniques to solve problems
* modern pure mathematics is primarily concerned with **precise statements** about mathematical objects
    * **MATHEMATICAL OBJECTS ARE THINGS LIKE INTEGERS, REAL NUMBERS, SETS, FUNCTIONS, ETC.**
* here are some mathematical statements :
    * there are infinitely many prime numbers
    * for every real number a, the equation x^2 + a = 0 has a real root
    * \sqrt{2} is irrational
    * if p(n) denotes the number of primes less than or equal to the natural number n, then as n becomes very large, p(n) approaches n/log_{e}{n}
- not only are mathematicians interested in statements like these, they are above all, interested in knowing which statements are true, and which are false
- the truth or falsity in each case is demonstrated not by observation or measurements or experiment, as in the natural sciences, but **by a proof**
- in this course, we look at some different ways of proving statemen
