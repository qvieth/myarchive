- confirmation bias : we seek information what we already believe
- notice things but don't pay attention
- the world inside of you dictate your life
- slowly and progressively eliminate what you noticed
- MIND FEED : IF YOU DON'T CONSTANTLY FEED YOUR MIND WITH POSITIVE MOTIVATION, INSPIRATION SOMETHING THAT MOVES TOWARD YOUR GOALS, weeds grow
- don't watch news, most news are designed with negativity
- what you say to yourself becomes your self-fulfilling prophecy
- not I WANT but I AM
