## FLEETING NOTES

- cartesian product of relations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58i-sZ6h1mI
     - the result is itself a relation
     - its rows contain all of the columns from the combined relations

## PRINCIPLES

```from precalculus - james stewart - prologue P3
* PRICIPLE OF PROBLEM SOLVING :
    1. understand the problem
    2. introduce notation
    3. state what is given
    4. identify the unknown
    5. connect the unknown with the given
```

1. [math vocab](math-vocab)
2. combination = permutation devided by `number of ways that you can arrange k people`
3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#/media/File:Argument_terminology_used_in_logic_(en).svg
4. mathematics - discovery and proof
5. maths is about modeling (get this ideas from reading precalculus)
6. http://www.corestandards.org/Math/ | http://www.corestandards.org/other-resources/key-shifts-in-mathematics/
7. MATH IS A LANGUAGE : => think about how you use dictionary to search words
8. **STUDY MATH FROM THE BIG IDEAS or FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM DOWN**

15. [Q: How can something be “proven” in science or math?](https://www.askamathematician.com/2017/08/q-how-can-something-be-proven-in-science-or-math/)
       - think maths as chess
       - rules in mathematics are called **axioms**
       - (similar to laws in physics)
       - results based on those rules are **theorems**
       - proofs in math similar to hypothesis testing in scientific inquiry
