# data science application

there are many different applications and kinds of projects that you can do once you know a bit of data science : 
    - __Reports__ - a way of presenting your process, insights, and recommendations
    - __Recommender Systems__ - a process that uses data about users and items to predict interest
    - __Dynamic Pricing__ - a strategy that takes into account factors such as demand to increase and decrease prices to drive profit
    - __Natural Language Processing__ - ways of analyzing text to gain insights as well as support applications, such as chatbots
    - there are many applications beyond just the ones that weâ€™ve covered here.
    
- similar to how data science is made up of different discipline, the applications of data science are far ranging
- but in all of these situations, you will apply data science to __find patterns, draw meaningful conclusions, and make decisions__

## reports
- reports are the most fundamental application of data science
- a report is a document in which you present your process and your findings
- reports are important because they enable those work with data to translate numbers and calculations into accessible __insights__ and recommendation for team members
- a report could take the form of a application that circulated within your company, or an article that's publish on the internet, or as part of a conference presentation
- a good report should have the following characteristics :
    - __simple__ : non-technical team members will need to be able to quickly grasp findings
    - __clear__ : language should be to the point
    - __engaging presentation__ : charts and presentations should be well designed
- [five-thirty-eight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/) is a popular statistic website that publishes reports on a range of topics, such as politics and sports

## recommendation engines
- one of the more well-known applications of data science is using data and machine learning to build a __recommended system__, aka __recommendation engine__
- a __recommendation system__ is a type of content filtration system that seeks to predict what a user would be interested in consuming
- these suggestions could come from the user's preferences that they've shared with the platform
- like how amazon suggest things you might want to buy based off of previous purchases
- other recommender system work by looking at the preferences of people in your network , or those of people with similar demographics
- recommender systems work for all types of information, form spotify using it to recommend new artists to netflix predicting what will be your next binge fest

## dynamic pricing
- __dynmaic pricing__, aka __surge pricing__, is the practice of __setting prices__ for products or services __based on market demand__
- dynamic pricing exists across several industries, including transportation, entertainment, amusement parks, and professional sports
- the most common example is airline tickets
- airlines started to use computers to determine flight prices as early as 1950s, taking into account the season, day of the week and time of day when setting ticket prices
- however, airlines have recently come under scruitiny for ultilizing more robust dynamic pricing techniques
- several are now determining fares based on the buyer
- while dynamic pricing is increasingly common, its a tactic that is often seen to benefit the company more than the consumer

## natural language processing
- while data science typically makes you think of numbes it can also be helpful in recognizing trends and patterns in language
- __natural language processing__ is the application of programming and artifical intelligence to __process and analyze text__
- in natural language processing, your datasets are made up of examples of language usage, known as __corpus__
- after __training on this dataset__, a machine can then perform different functions, such as __part-of-speech taggging__, __language translation__, and __sentiment analysis__
- a common application of natural language processing is chatbots
- while many chatbots follow pre-determined scripts, more advanced one can use natural language processing to enable dynamic discourse
- natural language processing enables a bot to continue learning as it talks, making it better at handling different and unexpected situations
