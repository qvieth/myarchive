# netflix recommendation engine
## what's data got to do with it
- big data refers to massive datasets that can be used to __massive__ reveal __patterns__ and __trends__, any __large quantity__ of information
- and since big data is so, well , big, we need __optimized algorithms__ and __high-powered computers__ to sift through it
- advances in data science have __changed the way we communicate, share and receive information__
- consider how big data has changed our TV and movie experiences
- companies like netflix collect thousands of data points from several places to make suggestions to users with the help of a tool known as __recommendation engine__
- but __how__ did the netflix engineering team build a recommendation engine?
- netflix uses __machine learning__, a __subset__ of __artificial inteligence__, to help their algorithms __learn__ without human assistance
- __machine learning__ gives the platform the ability to __automate__ millions of decisions based off of user activities
- the need for recommendation engines and personalization is a result of phenomenon known as  the __era of abundance__
- we have a huge variety of choices because of how much is available through the internet

## how netflix slay the recommendation game
- today, online platforms like netflix offer thousands of movies and shows
- how ever this much choice can be overwhelming for users
- with over 7000 movies and shows in the netflix catalog, it is nearly impossible for users to find movies they'll like on their own
- the large platform needs a recommendation engine algorithm to automate the search process for users
- __there are multiple potential methods__ for creating a recommendation engine
- the method you choose simply depends on the size of the user base, the size of the catalog, and the goals of the platform
- a basic implementation of a recommendation engine would be the __editorial method__
- in the __editorial method__ the platform would make recommendations based on a relatively small amount of individuals
- another easy one is the aptly nameed __simple collection method__ where the platform makes suggestions based on the top products come across the platform
- netflix doesn't use those recommendation methods because they don't allow for personalization
- or cover the breadth of the movie catalogs and user preferences
- instead, netflix uses the __personalized method__ where movies are suggested to the users who are most likely to enjoy them based on a metric like major actors or genre
- machine learning is necessary for this method because it uses user data to make informed suggestions
- this way netflix methodology accounts for diversity in its audiences and its very large catalogs

## netflix is all probability
- machine learning is able to create 'smart' platforms because it uses __probability__ to discover the likelihood of a user liking a product
- to understand the probability aspect of __recommendation engine__
- __ultility matrix__, a probability model which places a score on the __relationship__ between a user and a movie type in order to predict their preferences

# summary
- at netflix they even go beyond recommending movie titles and use recommendation engines to __curate__ the preview images you're seeing on your feed
- machine learning techniques at netflix have completely disrupted the way television and movie industries operate
- we have data science to thank for having personalize experiences like netflix
- the field is growing rapidly in this __era of abundance__ so we have guidance when sorting through thousans of options to find the perfect products
- data science in our daily lives gives us access to __educated choices__ and more __curated experiences__
- the computer power and know-how of data scientist results in seamlessly __accurate decision-making__
