# correlation doesnt equal causation
- Today we’re going to talk about data relationships and what we can learn from them
- We’ll focus on correlation
    - which is a measure of how two variables move together
    - and we’ll also introduce some useful statistical terms you’ve probably heard of
    - like regression coefficient, correlation coefficient (r), and r^2
- But first, we’ll need to introduce a useful way to represent __bivariate continuous data__ - the __scatter plot__
- The __scatter plot__ has been called “the most useful invention in the history of statistical graphics”
    - but that doesn’t necessarily mean it can tell us everything
- Just because two data sets move together doesn’t necessarily mean one CAUSES the other
- This gives us one of the most important tenets of statistics: correlation does not imply causation  



- __scatterplot__ best for analyzing relationship between variables
- coefficient r
- examples the mayor uses are perfect examples of things that can go wrong when interpreting correlations
- when A correlated with another B, there's a few possible reason :
    - A causes B
    - B causes A
    - Variables C causes both A and B
    - No relationship at all
