- exponential is so incredibly important
- growth of money follows exponential growth
- steepness depends on the base :
    - always cross y = 1 at x = 0
   - 0 < x < 1
   - x = 1
   - x > 1
   - function note :
       - you're not gonna get exponential function if :
           - base is 0
           - base is 1
           - base is negative
   - f(x) = x^2 , x**3 is polynomial (not exponential)
   - f(x) = 6^x is exponential
   - f(-2)^x : is just a valid function, it's just not a exponential function
