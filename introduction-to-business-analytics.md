## what is analytics

-   break down
-   turn data into insights
-   a note about terminology :
    -   business analytics
    -   business inteligence
    -   decision science
    -   data science
    -   data mining
    -   bla, bla, bla
-   there are some differences,but
-   => they all support the same goal : "**turning data into useful insight**"

## the types

1.  **descriptive analytics** : what happened
2.  **predictive analytics** : what might happened
3.  **prescriptive analytics** : what should we do

| descriptive                    | predictive/prescriptive                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| what were our sales?           | what are the expected sales?           |
| what was our market share?     | what is the expected market share?     |
| what product was most popular? | what product should we market to them? |

## the lifecycle

-   the "scientific method" for analytics
-   it's the tried and true way of doing things
-   **CRISP** : Cross-Industry Standard Process
-   **CRISP - DM** : Cross-Industry Standard Process for **Data Mining**
    -   business understanding <=> data understanding => data preparation => modeling => evaluating => deployment

1. business understanding :
    - we should always start with **business problems** (we aren't just doing analytics for fun, we need to have some business goal in mind)
        - ex :
            - **optimzie pricing** to boost revenue
            - **segment customers** to tailor product offers
            - **pinpoint bottlenecks** and failure points in our supply chain...
2. data understanding :
    - venn diagram : **data we have** \intersect **data we need**
    - ask questions after getting the data :
        - avaiability?
        - quality?
        - granlarity?
        - frequency?
        - etc..
    - a 'sandbox' is a safe space to explore. 'production' is for live data
3. data preparation :
    - this can be extremely **TIME-CONSUMING**
4. modeling :
    - what is a model? : simplified description of a system or process to assist calculations and predictions
        - a model mimic the real world, it's our version of it
        - ex :
            - math model, lego model of a house,...
            - a model that predicts the likelihood that a car insurance customer will get into an acident in the next year
    - a few phase to do in modeling :
        - EDA
        - variable selection
        - model selection
    - common modeling tools : python and R
5. evaluation and deployment :
    - ask question like :
        - how effective is the model?
        - are we prepared to launch it?

## the tools

-   popular analytics tools :
    -   microsoft excel : allow you to explore/analyze smaller datasets
    -   tableau desktop, microsoft power bi : allow you to visualize your data with dashboards
    -   python, R : allow you to build statistical models that can make prediction about your data
    -   sql : allow you to communicate and interact with databases
